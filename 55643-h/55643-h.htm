<p>The investigations embodied in this book were begun in 1894,
on the suggestion of Mr. Graham Wallas, and at the request of
Mr. J. A. Spender. They were continued in subsequent years,
in conjunction with the London School of Economics, and the
results were summarised in a thesis entitled “<cite>The Enclosure of
Common Fields in England in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth
Centuries</cite>,” which was submitted to the University of London
in 1904, and approved as a thesis for the degree of Doctor of
Science in Economics. That thesis consisted in the first place
of a series of maps, partially reproduced in this volume through
the kind assistance of the Royal Geographical Society; and in
the second place of manuscript matter which has been revised
for publication in the form of this volume and under the
present title. The original maps are in the custody of the
London School of Economics, and can be seen by those who
desire to examine them. They include a series of county maps,
on which parishes in which common fields have been enclosed
by Act of Parliament are coloured and marked according to the
date of enclosure, and maps illustrating the process of Parliamentary
enclosure, and the working of the common field system.
Those who are interested in the enclosure history of any
particular county may also be recommended to consult the
<cite>Victoria County History</cite>.</p>

<p>It is my pleasant duty here to gratefully acknowledge my
obligations to the two gentlemen above mentioned for the original
impulse to study the process of the destruction and decay of
English village communities; to the London School of Economics;
and in particular to its first Director, Mr. W. A. S. Hewins, its
present Director, Mr. H. J. Mackinder, and Mr. Hubert Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
for assistance, encouragement, and advice; to many labourers,
farmers, clergymen, and other rural residents, for information
and personal kindness; to the Royal Geographical Society for
defraying the cost of the production of the blocks of the illustrative
maps herewith published; and to Earl Carrington, the
President of the Board of Agriculture, for reading the book in
proof, and recommending it to those who are willing to study
rural history because they desire to improve rural conditions
of life.</p>

<p>In writing this book I have deemed it a matter of conscience
to preserve the attitude of mind of the student of history, pure
and simple. I have felt, and feel, that historical investigation
can only be rightly carried on when all motives except the simple
desire to know the truth are excluded from the investigator’s
mind. Yet the investigation undertaken having been thus far
completed, and its results placed on record, I cannot refrain from
attempting to read out of them some lessons for the present and
the future.</p>

<p>My conclusions have been in large measure expressed for me
by Lord Carrington’s Introduction. The policy of the legislature
and of the Central Government, expressed in the Enclosure
Acts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, though it
claimed, and on the whole rightly claimed, that it effected
an immediate and great increase in the country’s output of
agricultural produce, and an improvement in the breeds of
sheep and cattle, was nevertheless essentially a policy directed
towards the enhancement of agricultural rents, the building
up of large and compact landed estates, the establishment of
capitalist farming, the uprooting of peasant proprietors and
of small holdings together with the communal use of land,
and the multiplication of the class of landless agricultural
labourers. There is need in the twentieth century for a new
agricultural policy. As I read the economic signs of the time,
industrial conditions are beginning to favour a great agricultural
revival in the British Isles. A wise programme of rural reform
is necessary both in order that the possible agricultural
prosperity may be secured, and in order that the nation may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
reap in full its possible fruits of physical and moral well-being
for the people.</p>

<p>In all times the fading memories and traditions of the past
have contributed to form in men’s minds the ideals of a possible
better future state of society which are the inspiration of
progress. The memories and traditions of the English village
community, together with its visible relics in the form of
commons, commonable meadows, and (rarely) common fields,
have had their influence on the formation of the ideals of the
Labour and Democratic movement of our country from the
time of Cobbett onwards. Through historical research the
past may become more definitely suggestive.</p>

<p>The suggestions borne into my mind for the agricultural policy
of the twentieth century may be summed up in the phrase,
British agriculture must be democratised. By this I mean that
the principle of collective ownership of the soil must be established
or re-established; that agricultural co-operation must be
revived in new forms suitable to modern conditions; that the
ancient right of independent access to the soil for every tiller of
it must be restored; that a career of industrial advance in agriculture
must be made possible for the competent worker. On
one important side of the life of the old English village community
I have not touched at all in this book, viz., its social and
recreative side. In this respect also the losses of the past will
probably be recovered spontaneously if the nation aims in its
agricultural policy at the three essentials of wholesome, hopeful,
human work, as opposed to dehumanised toil, Freedom, Training
and Mutual Aid.</p>

<span class="sub_head_intro">THE ENGLISH PEASANTRY AND THE ENCLOSURE
OF COMMON FIELDS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> enclosure of common fields, and the passing away of the
English Village Community to make room for the agricultural
organisation prevailing to-day, is a subject not merely of historical
interest, but one which touches very closely some of the most
vital national problems of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>During the past five generations mechanical, industrial, and
commercial progress, with the consequent creation of great towns
and cities, has so occupied the national activities, and has made
us to such an extent a nation of town-dwellers, that there has
been a tendency to overlook rural life and rural industries. But
in recent years social reformers have come to see that the
solution of many of the problems of the town is to be found in
the country, and increasing attention is being paid to the causes
of the rural exodus and the best means by which it can be
arrested. No industry can be in a healthy condition which does
not provide an opportunity for the small man to improve his
position; and consequently such questions as the provision of
allotments and small holdings, agricultural co-operation, the
preservation of the independence of spirit of the agricultural
labourer, and the securing for him the prospect of a continually
advancing career on the land are recognised as matters of urgent
national importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span></p>

<p>In this book Dr. Slater shows that the movement for the
enclosure of arable open and common fields has been a movement
for the sweeping away of small holdings and small properties;
that the “Village Community” which any Enclosure Act of this
character abolished was essentially an organisation for agricultural
co-operation. He shows that at least in certain parts of
the country even in comparatively recent times enclosure has
produced rural depopulation, and has converted the villager from
“a peasant with a mediæval status to an agricultural labourer
entirely dependent on a weekly wage.” He further makes us
doubt whether these little village revolutions, while they
temporarily stimulated agricultural progress by facilitating
improved stock-breeding and the economy of labour, did not also
to a certain extent destroy the opportunities of future progress
by separating farmer from labourer by a gulf difficult to cross,
and thus cutting off the supply of new recruits to the farming
class.</p>

<p>At the same time, whatever reasons there may be for regretting
the enclosure of our Common Fields, and for wishing that
the interests of the humbler tillers of the soil had been more
sedulously guarded on enclosure, in the main the process was
inevitable. Common field Agriculture was a survival of customs
and institutions which had grown up when each village lived its
life to a great extent in isolation. It was necessary that the
villager should almost forget that he was a Little Pedlingtonian
to realise that he was an Englishman. Village patriotism had
to die down temporarily to make way for national patriotism;
and when the spirit died out of the Village Community its form
could not be preserved.</p>

<p>Now and in the future there is need that local patriotism,
pride in the local community, and willingness to serve it, whether
it be village or city, should be kindled again to its old vigour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
With the revival of the spirit will come a revival of some of the old
forms of village common life, and a creation of new forms in place
of those which will remain among the forgotten facts of the past.
The Village Community is a hope of the future as well as a
memory of the past, and therefore those who are interested in the
movement for reviving British Agriculture on democratic lines
and for improving the social and economic conditions of our
villages have reason to welcome Dr. Slater’s attempt to describe
existing and recent survivals of the English Village Community,
and to ascertain the circumstances, causes, and consequences of
its gradual extinction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> internal history of our villages is a more obscure, but
not less important a part of English history, than the internal
history of our towns. It is, indeed, more fundamental. A
town is ordinarily by origin an overgrown village, which never
loses the marks of its origin. And it was by agricultural and
social changes in the villages that the way was prepared for the
great industrial revolution, or more properly, evolution, which is
the underlying fact of the history of English towns, especially
during the last two centuries.</p>

<p>The central fact in the history of any English village since
the Middle Ages, is expressed in the word “enclosure.”
Primarily “enclosure” means surrounding a piece of land
with hedges, ditches, or other barriers to the free passage of
men and animals. Agriculturally, enclosure of arable land in
the midst of unenclosed arable land is a preliminary step to its
conversion into pasture, the hedge is erected to keep animals
in; enclosure of land in the midst of open common pasture is a
preliminary step to tillage, the hedge keeps animals out. But in
either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> case the hedge is the mark and sign of exclusive ownership
and occupation in the land which is hedged. Hence by enclosure
collective use, usually accompanied by some degree of community
of ownership, of the piece of land enclosed, is abolished, and
superseded by individual ownership and separate occupation.</p>

<p>The form of enclosure which is familiar to our minds is the
enclosure of land previously uncultivated; in the legal phrase,
“enclosure of waste of a manor,” in the ordinary phrase,
“enclosure of commons.” Enclosure in this sense has been,
and is still, a matter of very vital interest to the urban population,
a fact which might be brought vividly to our minds by a
recital of the commons within London and its immediate
neighbourhood which have been lost or preserved with difficulty.
It is sufficient to refer to Epping Forest, Hadley Wood, Hampstead
Heath, Wimbledon Common, Hayes and Keston Commons,
Bostall Heath and Plumstead Common.</p>

<p>Far more important from a broad national point of view, is
the enclosure of common fields&mdash;the enclosure, that is, of land
previously cultivated according to a system which did not involve
the separation of one holding from another by any tangible
barrier. Enclosure of this sort, when suddenly effected, as by
a Private Act of Enclosure, is rightly termed the extinction of a
village community. In the following chapters it will be shown
in detail from existing and recent survivals, what was the nature
of the system of cultivation in open and common fields in different
parts of England, up to the time of enclosure; the question
when and how enclosure was brought about in different
counties will be discussed; and light will be thrown upon the
result of the transition from the medieval to the modern system
of village life upon the material and moral condition of the
villagers, the peasants, farmers or labourers, who underwent the
change. In these chapters facts drawn directly from observations
and inquiries in the villages themselves, from the observations
of agricultural writers who speak from direct and intimate
knowledge, and from the Enclosure Acts, will be left in the main
to tell their own story. But a generalised statement will perhaps
make that story clearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>Here is a typical Enclosure Act of the type which encloses
common fields, taken at random, and a good example of the
2565 Acts of its class enumerated in the <a href="#appendix_b" title="Go to Appendix B.">Appendix</a>, by which
about 3000 parishes were enclosed. It was passed in 1795
(<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 43) and begins:&mdash;“Whereas there are in the parish of
Henlow, in the County of Bedford, divers Open and Common
Fields, Meadows, Pastures, Waste Lands, and other Commonable
Lands and Grounds, containing by estimation, Two Thousand
Acres, or thereabouts.... And whereas the said Open and
Common Fields, Lands, Grounds, Meadows and Pastures, lie intermixed,
and are inconveniently situated, and are in their present
state incapable of Improvement, and the several Proprietors
thereof and Persons interested therein are desirous that the
same may be divided and enclosed, and specific Shares thereof
set out and allotted in Lieu and in Proportion to their several and
respective Estates, Rights, and Interests therein; but such Division
and Inclosure cannot be effected without the Aid and Authority
of Parliament. May it therefore please your Majesty&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>The total area of the parish of Henlow is 2450 acres, and it
has a large park. It appears, therefore, that when the Act was
passed practically the whole of the arable, meadow, and pasture
land in the parish lay entirely open, and was commonable. The
more remote and least cultivable parts of the parish were, no doubt,
common pastures; on these the villagers kept flocks and herds
according to some recognised rule based on the sizes of their
holdings in the arable fields. A drift would lead from the
common to the village, passing through the arable fields, and
fenced or hedged off from them. Immediately behind the
cottages, clustering together to form the village, there would
be small closes for gardens or paddocks; beyond these all round
the village would stretch the open, common, arable fields, in
area probably considerably more than half the parish. These
were probably divided into three or four approximately equal
portions, and cultivated according to a three or four year course,
imposed rigidly on all occupiers by a mutual agreement sanctioned
by custom. The holdings would be of various sizes, from three
or four acres of arable land upwards, but all small; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
holding of, say, twenty acres of arable land would consist of
about thirty separate strips of land of from half an acre to an
acre each, scattered over all the three or four arable fields, but
approximately equally divided between each field, so that each
year the occupier would have, for example, about five acres under
wheat, five under barley, five under pulse, and five fallow, provided
that were the customary course of husbandry. Right
through the year the fallow land would be used as common
pasture, and the land under crops would become commonable
after the crops were carried.</p>

<p>Along the streams flowing into the river Ivel would be the
open commonable meadows. These would be divided into a
number of plots, half-acres, quarter-acres, or even smaller,
marked by pegs driven in the ground, or stones; and a certain
number of these plots were assigned to each holding, in
proportion to the amount of arable land. During the spring,
while the cattle were on the common pasture, the meadow would
be let grow for hay; when the time for hay harvest came, each
peasant cut his own plots, and the meadow became commonable
during the rest of the summer. Some of the peasant occupiers
would be small freeholders, some probably copyholders, others
legally annual tenants. All would meet together on certain
occasions to settle questions of common interest.</p>

<p>We might say, though the expression must not be too rigidly
interpreted, that under the common field system the parish,
township, or hamlet formed one farm, occupied and cultivated by
a group of partners holding varying numbers of shares. It may
well be imagined what a village cataclysm took place when an
Act for the enclosure of the parish was passed, and commissioners
descended upon the village, valued every property and every
common right, and carved out the whole parish into rectangles,
instituting the modern system of separate exclusive ownership
and individual cultivation. We shall see that ordinarily the
holdings on enclosure became fewer and larger, that very many
of the peasants were in consequence driven from the village, or
became landless, pauperised agricultural labourers. We shall
see also that the traditions of the common field system where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
they have perished as distinct memories, have survived in the
form of aspirations for agricultural reform. In fact, the great
rural question for the twentieth century to determine, is whether
there were not beneath the inconvenient and uneconomical
methods of the common field system, a vital principle essential
to true rural prosperity, which has to be re-discovered and
re-established in forms suitable to the present environment.</p>

<p>It is not intended in this book to go into the vexed question
of the origin of the common field system, or of the English
village community. It will be noticed that the researches upon
which this book is based do not as a rule go further back than
Leland’s Itinerary in 1536 and following years. From such
materials only hypotheses can be obtained, which require to be
tested by all the evidence from earlier records. A hypothesis,
however, has a certain value as a mental thread by which the
facts can be connected and more clearly conceived.</p>

<p>Judging entirely from eighteenth and nineteenth century
evidence, one is in the first place driven to accept most unhesitatingly
the prevailing theory that the English common field
system was based on co-aration. But one is tempted to very
summarily dismiss the theory of Roman origin. Rather one is
inclined to say that as long as a considerable portion of the
villagers of the parish were accustomed to yoke their oxen or
harness their horses to a common plough, the system was a
living one, capable of growth and modification according to the
ideas of the people who worked it. It became, as it were,
fossilised and dead, incapable of other than decaying change,
when each occupier cultivated his own set of strips of land by his
own plough or his own spade. One is therefore inclined to
suppose that the introduction of each new element in the population
of a village&mdash;Saxon, Angle, Dane, and in a less degree,
Norman&mdash;profoundly modified earlier customs, and that in each
part of Britain a local type of village community resulted from
the blending of different racial traditions.</p>

<p>This hypothesis is directly suggested by the evidence of recent
survivals. The most familiar type of village community is
characteristic of the Midlands; I have termed it the Mercian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
type. It is most easily conceived as a compound of the pure
Keltic system, known in the Highlands and Ireland as Run-rig or
Rundale, and the North German system traditional among the
Angles, in which the two elements in equal strength are very
perfectly blended together. In the South of England we find a
different type, here termed the Wessex type, in which the
influence of Keltic tradition is more strongly seen. The village
community in Norfolk and the adjoining part of Suffolk shows
some remarkable special features, traces of which are found in
adjoining counties, but which appear to be easily accounted for
as the result of the later intrusion of Scandinavian traditions.
Further, throughout the West of England, from Cumberland to
Devon and Cornwall, we find evidence that the primitive type of
village community approximated very closely to the Keltic
Run-rig.</p>

<p class="mini_gap_above">Enclosure of the common fields, meadows and pastures, of
any particular village may have taken place in the following
ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) By Act of Parliament, viz., (<i>a</i>) by a private Act, (<i>b</i>) under
the authority of the General Enclosure Acts of 1830 and 1836,
(<i>c</i>) by the Enclosure Commissioners and their successors, the
Board of Agriculture, under the General Enclosure Act of 1845
and its amending Acts.</p>

<p>(2) By common agreement of all the collective owners.</p>

<p>(3) By the purchase on the part of one owner of all conflicting
rights.</p>

<p>(4) By special licence of the Tudor monarchs.</p>

<p>(5) By various forms of force and fraud.</p>

<p>Commonable waste may have been enclosed in any of the
above ways, and also under the Statutes of Merton and Winchester
(1235 and 1285), which give Lords of the Manor the right
of enclosing commons provided proof is given that the tenants of
the manor are left sufficient pasture.</p>

<p>Enquiry into the history of Enclosure naturally begins with
an examination of the Enclosure Acts.</p>

<p>The first fact elicited by this examination is that there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
perfect <em>legal</em> similarity between Acts for enclosing commonable
waste, which may be termed <em>Acts for extending cultivation</em>, and
Acts such as that for Henlow, for enclosing all the open and
common arable and other lands of a parish or parishes, which
may be termed <em>Acts for extinguishing village communities</em>.
About one-third of the Enclosure Acts belong to the former
variety, about two-thirds to the latter. As from the economic
and social points of view, the two classes of Enclosure Acts are
as widely different as they are legally similar, no statistical
summaries of the Acts can have much value until the two classes
are sorted out. To do this involved a separate examination of
all the Acts accessible.</p>

<p><a href="#appendix_a" title="Go to Appendix A.">Appendix A</a> contains a statistical summary of the Acts for
enclosing commonable waste passed between 1727 and 1845;
<a href="#appendix_b" title="Go to Appendix B.">Appendix B</a> contains a list of Acts for enclosing common arable
fields with or without other commonable lands passed between
1727 and 1900.</p>

<span class="sub_head">THE MERCIAN TYPE OF VILLAGE COMMUNITY.</span></h2>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Laxton, an Open Field Parish.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the best surviving example of an open field parish is
that of Laxton, or Lexington, in Nottinghamshire, about ten
miles from Newark and Southwell. It lies remote from railways
and high roads, and is only to be reached by bye roads. From
whatever quarter one approaches the village, one enters the parish
through a gate. The village is in the centre of the parish, and
is surrounded by enclosed fields. Other enclosures are to be
found on the most remote parts of the parish, in some cases
representing, apparently, old woodland which has been converted
into tillage or pasture; in other cases portions of the arable
fields. But nearly half the area of the parish remains in the
form of two great arable fields, and two smaller ones which are
treated as two parts of the third field. The different holdings,
whether small freeholds or farms rented from the Lord of the
Manor, who owns nearly all the parish, consist, in part, of strips
of land scattered all over these fields, in a manner which can
best be understood by reference to the <a href="#laxton" title="Go to the map of Laxton.">map</a>. Within these arable
fields cultivation is not carried on according to the discretion of
the individual farmer, but by strict rules of great antiquity. In
each of the fields a three year course is rigidly adhered to.</p>

<p>First year, wheat.</p>

<p>Second year, spring corn (<i>i.e.</i> barley, oats, peas, beans,
vetches, tares, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>).</p>

<p>Third year, fallow.</p>

<p class="noindent">If, therefore, Laxton be visited early in June, the following
description of the appearance of the parish will be found correct.
The traveller passes through the boundary gate. He finds his
road leads him through the “Spring corn” field, which lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
open on either side of the road. A phrase which is continually
used by old farmers when attempting to describe common fields
will probably occur to him in this field: “It is like allotments.”
But it is like an allotment field with many differences.</p>

<div class="chapter figcenter" id="laxton">
   <img src="images/laxton.jpg" alt="Laxton and part of Mill Field" title="Laxton and part of Mill Field" width="400" height="611" />
</div>

<p>All the great field is divided up into oblong patches, each
patch growing its own crop, but with no more division or
boundary between one crop and the next than a mere furrow.</p>

<p>If, then, the traveller looks again at a strip of land growing,
say, beans, he will find that this strip consists of one, two, or
more ridges, locally termed “lands.” A “land” in Laxton
has a pretty uniform width of 5½ yards, and a normal length of
one furlong; but by the necessity of the case the length varies
considerably. Owing to this variation in length the various
strips of land which make up the different holdings in the
common fields, when their area is expressed in acres, roods, or
poles, seem to have no common measure.</p>

<p>Because the soil of Laxton is a heavy clay it is customary to
plough each “land” every year in the same manner, beginning
at the edges, and turning the sod towards the centre of the
“land.” Hence each “land” forms a long narrow ridge,
heaped up in the middle, and the lie of the “lands” or ridges
was at some unknown date so well contrived for the proper
drainage of the land, that it is probable that if the whole of a
field were let to a single farmer, he would still plough so as to
maintain the old ridges.</p>

<p>The same ridges are to be found on the other two fields, one
of which is a stretch of waving wheat; while the third, or fallow
field, is being leisurely ploughed, a number of sheep getting a
difficult living from the thistles and other weeds in the still
unploughed portions, and on the “sicks,” <i>i.e.</i> certain grassy
parts of the field which are defined by boundary marks, and are
never allowed to be ploughed. In one extreme corner of the
parish is Laxton Heath, a somewhat swampy common covered
with coarse grass. Here, too, sheep are grazed in common,
according to a “stint” somewhat recently determined upon.
Before the stint was agreed to, every commoner had the right of
turning out as many sheep as he could feed in winter, the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
being that the common was overstocked, and the sheep nearly
starved. The stint regulates the number of sheep each commoner
may graze upon the common according to the number he can feed
on his other land in the parish. It was not adopted without
opposition on the part of those whose privileges it restricted.</p>

<p>This brings us to the question, Who are the commoners?
There are two sorts of claim by which a man may be entitled to
common rights, and to a voice in such deliberations as those by
which a stint is agreed to. One is by a holding in the common
open fields, the other is by the occupation of a “toft-head.” A
“toft” is not very easy to define. One may say that it either
is, or represents, an ancient house or cottage in the village; but
that immediately suggests the question, How ancient? It
is well known in the village which cottages are “tofts” and
which are not. Those which are, command a rent about <abbr title="2 pounds">£2</abbr> a
year higher in consequence. It is to be noted that if the
house or cottage which is the visible sign of “toft-head” be
pulled down, and a new one erected on the same spot, the new
house has the same rights attached to it. One is naturally led
to the hypothesis that up to a certain date<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> all cottages erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
in Laxton carried common rights, but that after that date no
new common rights could be created. There are, therefore, two
classes of commoners: the farmers who hold land in the common
fields, and the labourers who occupy the privileged cottages. A
farmer may possess a number of common rights in respect of
(1) his farmhouse, if it be a “toft,” (2) his arable holding, and
(3) any toft cottages he may own or rent and sub-let to labourers,
retaining their common rights. The labourer has but one
common right. Each common right entitles the holder to one
vote, and to one share in the division of the money revenues
drawn from the commonable lands, besides the right of feeding
an indefinite number of sheep on the fallow field, and the
regulated number on the common. The money revenue that
comes from the commonable fields is obtained as follows: The
grass lands (“sicks”) in the two common fields which are under
crops cannot be grazed upon conveniently, because any animals
would be liable to stray into the crops. They are, therefore,
mown for hay, and the right to mow them is sold by auction to
one of the commoners, and the price realised is divided.
Recently this has worked out at about <abbr title="14 shillings">14<i>s.</i></abbr> per common right.
Each commoner also has the right of pasturing animals upon the
two fields that are under crops, directly the harvest has been
carried.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>
We have here the practice of divorcing the cottage from its common right
described as a novelty. <cite>The Act of 31 Elizabeth, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 7</cite>, by prohibiting the letting
of cottages without 4 acres of land, in effect prohibited the letting of a cottage
without a common right, as the 4 acres <em>would</em> not be the highly valued Close,
and <em>could</em> not, unless the rights of other villagers were infringed, be waste or
common pasture. Four acres in the common arable field was implied, and this
of course carried a right of common.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The exercise of this right, which appears to be most keenly
valued, as it is found to persist in many parishes after all other
traces of the common field system have died away, obviously
opens the door to quarrels. It is not to be expected that all
farmers should finish carrying their crops on the same day; and
the position of the man who is behind all his neighbours, and so
is standing between the commoners and their right of pasture, is
not an enviable one. But a constitutional system of government
exists for the purpose of dealing with these and other difficulties.
A “Foreman of the Fields” and a “Field Jury” are elected:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the field jury settles all disputes between individuals, while the
duties of the foreman include that of issuing notices to declare
when the fields are open for pasturing; on which day all the
gates, by which, as I have previously mentioned, the parish is
entered, must be closed, while all the gates of the farmyards are
thrown open, and a varied crowd of animals winds along the drifts
and spreads over the fields.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the commonable lands of Laxton
include only arable fields and common pasture. The commonable
meadows which the parish once had, have been partitioned
and enclosed at a date beyond the recollection of the oldest
inhabitant. The neighbouring parish of Eakring still has
commonable meadows. In this respect Eakring is a more
perfect example of the open field parish than Laxton, though
its common arable fields have been much more encroached upon;
and have, in fact, been reduced to scattered fragments, so that
the rector was unable to tell me whether there were five, six, or
more of them. The villagers, however, say simply “Three: the
wheat field, the bean field, and the fallow field.” The commonable
meadows are, like the common fields, held in scattered strips
intermingled; and are commonable after hay harvest. The rule
in Eakring is that if one man only has any hay left on the
meadows, the other commoners can turn in their cattle and
relieve him of it; but if he can get a neighbour to leave but one
haycock also, he is protected.</p>

<p>The constitution of Eakring differs somewhat from that of
Laxton. There are regularly four toft meetings every year,
presided over by the steward of the lord of the manor, at which
all questions relating to the commonable lands are settled.
Further, all toft holders have an equal right to feed an indefinite
number of sheep on the fallow field, and the other fields when
available, but the exercise of the right is regulated by a species
of auction. The number of sheep that can be pastured with
advantage is agreed upon, and since the total number of sheep
which the assembled toft holders desire to put on is sure to
exceed that number, a price to be charged per sheep is by
degrees fixed by mutual bargaining, till the numbers of sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
for which their owners are willing to pay is reduced to the
number that the pasture can bear. The cottager and toft
holder, therefore, who though not holding an acre of land in the
parish, has yet enterprise enough to bid for the right of keeping
a flock of sixty sheep on the common fields, is therefore heartily
welcomed by that section of the toft holders who have no desire
to bid against him, because he forces up the value of their
rights.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">A Recent Enclosure&mdash;Castor and Ailesworth.</h3>

<p>Up till 1898 an even better example of an open-field parish
could be seen in Northamptonshire. In that year was completed
the enclosure of Castor and Ailesworth, two hamlets forming part
of the parish of Castor, situated three miles from Peterborough
on the road to Northampton. In 1892, when application was
made to the Board of Agriculture, which now represents the
Enclosure Commissioners of the General Enclosure Act of 1845,
there were in the two hamlets, out of a total area of 4976 acres,
2,425 acres of common arable fields, 815 acres of common
pastures and meadows, and 370 acres of commonable waste, and
only about 1300 acres enclosed. In Laxton the commonable
land is less than half the area of the parish. The greater
amount of old enclosure in Laxton has had its effect on the
distribution of the population. There are some, though very
few, outlying farmhouses. In Castor and Ailesworth all the
habitations and buildings, except a watermill and a railway
station, are clustered together in the two hamlets, which form
one continuous village. At present very nearly all the land of
Laxton and Eakring is in the ownership of the respective lords
of the two manors; in Castor and Ailesworth the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners are the largest landowners; but nearly as much
land is the property of Earl Fitzwilliam, and there are besides a
number of small landowners. Before enclosure all these
properties were intermixed all over the area of the two hamlets,
the two chief properties coming very frequently in alternate
strips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>Though the area of commonable land in Castor was so much
greater than in Laxton, those customs of village communal life
which we have described had retained much less vigour; and
to the decay of the power of harmonious self-government the
recent enclosure was mainly attributable. The customary
method of cultivation in Castor and Ailesworth was a three-field
system, but a different three-field system to that described
above. The succession of crops was:&mdash;First year, wheat;
second year, barley; third year, a “fallow crop,” or as locally
pronounced, “follow crop.” Each year in the spring the
farmers and toft-holders of Castor, and similarly of Ailesworth,
would meet to decide the crop to be sown on the fallow field.
One farmer, who held the position&mdash;though not the title&mdash;of
“Foreman of the Fields,” kept a “stint book,” a list of all the
villagers owning common rights, and the number of rights
belonging to each. The number of votes that could be cast by
each villager depended upon the number of his common rights.
The fallow crop might be pulse or turnips or other roots or
anything else that seemed advisable; but it was essential to the
<em>farmers’</em> interests that they should agree upon some crop. For
a tradition existed in the village that unless the farmers were
agreed as to the crop to be sown on the fallow field, that field
could be treated as though it really were fallow. It could be
pastured on all the year by all the toft-holders, and any crop
which any farmer might sow would be at the mercy of his
neighbours’ cattle and sheep. I could not find that this had
ever happened. On the other hand, the farmers being agreed
about the crop, they could also determine the date when the
fallow field should become commonable.<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> The wheat-field and
barley-field became commonable after harvest; the meadows
and pastures were commonable between August 12th and
February 14th.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#Anchor_2" title="Return to text.">[2]</a> This is good law. By <cite>13 <abbr title="George the Third">Geo. III.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 81</cite> these agreements could be made by
“a three-fourths majority in number and value.” <i>See</i> <a href="#chapter_9" title="Go to Chapter 9.">Chapter IX.</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The reason why the medieval three-field system was retained
in Laxton, but was altered in Castor to an improved three-field
system, is to be found in the nature of the soil. That of Laxton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
is a heavy clay, growing wheat of noted quality; that of the
Northamptonshire parish is lighter, in parts very shallow and
stony. Another result of the difference of soil was a different
system of ploughing. The Castor method was that technically
known as “Gathering and Splitting,” viz., alternately to plough
each strip from the margin inwards, turning the sod inwards,
and the reverse way, turning the sod outwards, so that the
general level of the field was not broken into a series of ridges.
In Castor, as in Laxton, no grassy “balk” divided one man’s
“land” from his neighbour’s, the furrow only had to serve as
boundary, and sometimes the boundary was bitterly disputed.
Before the enclosure there was one spot in the common fields
where two neighbours kept a plough each continually, and as
fast as one ploughed certain furrows into his land, the other
ploughed them back into his.</p>

<p>Another difficulty occasionally arose when high winds prevailed
at harvest time. The great extent of the open fields, and
the slightness of any opposition to the sweep of the wind, at
such times allowed the corn to be blown from one man’s land,
and scattered over his neighbours’. Indeed it recently happened
that one year when peas had been chosen as the fallow crop,
that a storm carried the whole crop to the hedge bordering the
field, and so mixed together in inextricable confusion the produce
belonging to thirty or forty different farmers.</p>

<p>Another source of dispute was one that has been a prolific
cause of trouble in common fields for centuries. Where the
extremities of a series of adjoining “lands” abut on a land
belonging to another series at a right angle, the land so abutted
on is termed a “head-land,” and the occupiers of the lands that
abut on it have the right of turning their ploughs on the headland,
and taking the plough from one strip to another along it. The
occupier of the headland therefore has to defer ploughing it till
all his neighbours have finished, and often chafes at the delay.
Recently a farmer in the unenclosed parish of Elmstone Hardwick,
near Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, attempted to find a
remedy for this inconvenience. He ploughed his headland at
the time that suited his convenience, and then sued his neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>bours
for trespass when they turned their ploughs in his land.
Needless to say he lost more by his action than by the trespass.</p>

<p>In Castor quarrelsome farmers were wise enough to avoid the
law courts. Instead, they wrote appealing against their neighbours
to their respective landlords, but the landowners were
unable to restore harmony. The death of a farmer who had
won the highest respect of his neighbours, and who had continually
used his great influence to allay ill-feeling and promote
harmony, brought on a state of tension that gradually became
unbearable; and the appointment by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners
of a new agent, who could not understand and had
no patience with the peculiarities of common-field farming, led
to steps being taken for enclosure.</p>

<p>The first step necessary was to obtain the agreement of the
great majority of the people interested. The agent in question,
assisted energetically by the leading farmer in Ailesworth,
succeeded in doing this without much difficulty. In 1892,
application was made for an order to the Board of Agriculture,
whose inspector reported warmly commending the project. The
simple statement of the farmers with regard to their farms, <i>e.g.</i>,
“I hold 175 acres in 192 separate parcels,” would convince him
that a change was necessary. The figures for holdings are not
given by the enclosure award, but a summary of the facts with
regard to some of the smaller properties gives the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Parliamentary enclosure, however, is not to be obtained
without conditions. That reckless disregard of the wider public
interests both of the locality and of the nation at large in the
land to be enclosed of which the administration of the General
Enclosure Act from 1845 to 1874 has been accused, has been
dispelled by the vigorous and ably-conducted agitation to which
we owe the preservation of Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath,
and many other priceless commons. In the enclosure of Castor
and Ailesworth, in the first place, Ailesworth Heath, which
occupies the highest and most remote corner of the parish,
was excluded from the operation of the Enclosure Act. It is
a wild little common which, beyond feeding a few sheep and
furnishing a quarry, seems to be fit for nothing but picnics and
blackberrying. Situated at the distance of about five miles from
Peterborough, which again stands on the margin of the fen
country, it will probably come to be valued by the townsmen
for its unprofitable wildness.</p>

<p>Next, the parish boasts its antiquities, the remains of a part
of the ancient Roman road from London to York, and certain
blocks of stone, locally known as Robin Hood and Little John.
The Enclosure Act provides for the preservation of these.</p>

<p>A bathing place in the River Nen, which bounds the parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
on the south, selected at the most convenient spot, and three
recreation grounds of 6 acres each, and one of 14 acres, are
handed over to the safe keeping of the parish councils of Castor
and Ailesworth, besides four pieces of land, making 42 acres in
all, for allotments and field gardens. The farmers mournfully
point out that these 76 acres thus reserved for the common use
and benefit of the villagers are some of the best land and the
most conveniently situated. The recreation grounds in particular
they scorn as foolishness. Possibly, however, because
the village prides itself on its prowess in the football field, the
indignation against this supposed fad of the central government
is mild compared with that expressed by some of the thrifty
people of Upton <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonards, near Gloucester, which was
being enclosed at the same time. Here the recreation ground
was dubbed by some the “ruination ground,” enticing as it did
the young lads from digging in their fathers’ allotments to cricket
and football, and so subverting the very foundation of good
morals.</p>

<p>Subject to these deductions, the whole of the open commonable
lands and many of the old enclosures, after being surveyed and
valued, and after roads, where necessary, had been diverted or
newly set out, were redistributed among the old proprietors so
as to give each his proportional share, as far as possible in the
most convenient manner. This was both a lengthy and a delicate
task, but it was finally completed in 1898, six years after the
matter first came before the Board of Agriculture. Each several
proprietor was then required to fence his allotment in the manner
prescribed by the commissioners who make the survey and award.
The cost of the survey and allotment usually works out at about
<abbr title="1 pound">£1</abbr> per acre; the cost of fencing may be a great deal more.
Though the Parliamentary expenses are now trifling, the total
cost of abolishing the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">system of mingle-mangle</span>,” as Carew
called it in 1600, in any parish where it still exists, is not to be
lightly faced in times of agricultural depression.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Two Dorset Manors&mdash;Stratton and Grimstone.</h3>

<p>Dorchester is bounded on the south by Fordington Field.
The parish of Fordington, up to the year 1875, was unenclosed;
it lay almost entirely open, and was divided into about eighty
copyholds, intermixed and intercommonable, the manor belonging
to the Duchy of Cornwall. But in 1875 the Duchy
authorities bought out the copyholders, and the old system
disappeared.</p>

<p>About three or four miles from Dorchester, along the road
to Maiden Newton and Yeovil, are the two adjoining villages
of Stratton and Grimstone, forming together the Prebend of
Stratton, belonging till recently to the See of Sarum, which
have only been enclosed since 1900. The enclosure was effected
without any Parliamentary sanction; it was brought about, I
am told by the present lord of the two manors, by the refusal
of the copyholders, who held by a tenure of lives, to “re-life.”
In consequence, all the copyholds, except a few cottages, have
fallen into the hands of the lord of the manor; all Grimstone
has been let to a single farmer, and Stratton divided into three
or four farms.</p>

<p>Besides the very late survival of the common field system in
these two manors, there are two other features which make them
specially notable. In the first place they are, agriculturally,
thoroughly characteristic of the Wessex type of open field village,
the type that prevailed over Berkshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire
and Dorset. In the second place, the manorial system of
village government survived with equal vigour; the proceedings
of the manorial courts and the customs of tillage and
pasturage forming manifestly only two aspects of one and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
same organisation. It is fortunate that the court-rolls for the
last two hundred years have been preserved, and that they are
in the safe custody of the present lord of the manor.</p>

<p>On the south-west the lands of Stratton and Grimstone are
bounded by a stream, the River Frome, flowing towards Dorchester,
from which Stratton Mill has the right of taking a
defined amount of water. Between the stream and the villages
are the commonable meadows; on the north-east of the villages
the arable fields, tapering somewhat, stretch up the hill slope to
Stratton and Grimstone Downs. The whole arrangement is
shown very clearly in the tithe commutation map, dated 1839.
The two manor farms were separate and enclosed, and lay side
by side along the boundary between the two manors, in each
case comprising about one-third of the cultivated land. The
remaining arable land in each manor formed, so far as fences
were concerned, one open field, divided into three oblong strips,
known respectively in Stratton as the East, Middle, and West
Field; in Grimstone as Brewer’s Ash Field, Rick Field, and
Langford Field. The rotation of crops was: (1), wheat;
(2), barley; (3), fallow. The lower part of the fallow field
was sown with clover, and was known as the “hatching
ground”&mdash;a term we find elsewhere in the forms “hitch-land”
and “hook-land”&mdash;the upper part was a bare fallow.
More recently an improved method of cultivation was adopted.
The barley crop every third year was maintained, but after it
was carried Italian rye grass was sown in the upper part of the
barley field (instead of a bare fallow). This was fed off with
sheep in the spring, and then put into turnips; the following
year barley was sown again. The lower part, however, continued
to be sown with clover in the fallow year, this was fed off
with sheep, and wheat followed.</p>

<p>The arable fields consisted of “lands” or “lawns,”<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> each
supposed to be 40 “yards” (<i>i.e.</i> poles) long, and one, two or
four “yards” broad&mdash;hence supposed to be quarter acres,
half acres, or acres. Half acres were the more common; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
whatever the area in theory it was somewhat less in actual
fact.</p>

<p>The West Field in Stratton was somewhat smaller than the
other two in consequence of the extreme portion&mdash;that next the
down and farthest from the village&mdash;being enclosed. These
enclosures in shape and arrangement exactly resemble the lands
in the open field; they are about one acre each. They are called
“The Doles.” Further there are a series of small square enclosures
taken out of the down, called “The New Closes.” All the
Doles and New Closes were in grass.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact is that all the “lands” were scrupulously
separated from one another by meres or balks of turf, which,
however, were not known by these names. Among the people
they were, and are, known as “walls,” but in the court-rolls one
finds the term “lanchetts,” which one connects with “lynches,”
and “land-shares,” which seems to explain the term “launchers”
which I have found in Devonshire. In the level parts of the
fields the “walls” were mere strips of turf about a foot wide;
but in the sloping parts they formed steep banks, sometimes
several feet high, and the successive “lands” formed terraces
one above the other.</p>

<p>All the cultivators, except the tenants of the two manor farms,
were copyholders, holding for a tenancy of three lives, the widow
of the holder having the right to continue the holding during the
period of her widowhood. By the custom of the manor the lessee
of the manor had at any time (even though his lease had but a
day to run) the right to grant a copyholder two lives, <i>i.e.</i>, to
accept a fine and substitute two new names for those of dead or
dying persons on the “copy.”</p>

<p>The copyholds, when not “cotes” or simply cottages with
common rights, were either “half-livings,” “livings,” or, in
one or two cases, other fractions of a living. A half-living consisted
of four or five nominal acres in each of the common fields,
and common rights upon the meadow, common fields and common
down, in Stratton, for one horse, two cows, and forty sheep. A
whole living consisted of a share about twice as large in the
field and meadow, and a common right for two horses, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
cows, and eighty sheep. But each copyhold, whether a whole
or half-living, included one dole and one new close. There
were three whole livings and twelve half-livings in Stratton, and
five “cotes,” <i>i.e.</i>, cottages with one or two strips of land in the
arable fields attached to them. In Grimstone there were four
whole livings, six half-livings, one three-quarters living, and
one whole and a-quarter living. In either manor, therefore, if
we reckon two half-livings as equal to one whole, there were
nine whole livings in all; those of Stratton being normally held
by fifteen copyholders, those of Grimstone by twelve, though
the number might happen in practice to be less. Thus at the
time of the tithe commutation (1838) there was in each manor
one copyholder who had two half-livings. In all formal documents
a “living” is termed a “place,” and a half-living a
“half-place.” The common rights attached to a living in
Grimstone were slightly different from those in Stratton. They
are further explained below.</p>

<p>Once a year, at about Christmas, the tenants of each manor
met, the steward presiding; the elected officials submitted their
accounts, and resigned their offices, and their successors were
re-elected. The most important of these were two “viewers of
the fields and tellers of the cattle,” commonly known simply as
the “viewers.” There was also a “hayward,” and two “chimney
peepers” (described in the Court-rolls as “inspectors of
chimnies”). The inspectors of chimneys do not appear in the
rolls of the eighteenth century; instead are the more important
officials the “constabul” (<i>sic</i>) and “tythingman,” who ceased
to be appointed presumably after the establishment of the county
police and the commutation of the tithes.</p>

<p>The duty of the “chimney peepers” was, as their name
implies, to see that chimneys were kept properly swept so as not
to endanger a neighbour’s thatched roof. The hayward was in
charge of the pound; he was entitled to charge <abbr title="4 pence">4<i>d.</i></abbr> a head for
all stray beasts impounded if they belonged to the manor, and
<abbr title="8 pence">8<i>d.</i></abbr> a head for outsiders.</p>

<p>The “viewers” had more varied duties. In the first place
they had to appoint one villager as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>“Lacy’s Bridge man.”
“Lacy’s Bridge” is a structure of loose stones at a place
where the stream, which for the most part bounds Stratton
meadow, crosses it; and the duty of the bridge man is to
keep it in sufficient repair to enable sheep to cross. The
viewers used to appoint the cottagers in turn, going down
one side of the road to the end of the village and up the
other side.</p>

<p>Next the viewers provided the manor bull. They bought the
bull, they charged a fee for his services, and made all necessary
regulations. The breed favoured varied from year to year, and
the viewers were never known to please everybody with their
choice.</p>

<p>Then the viewers appointed the common shepherd, in whose
charge were the sheep of the whole manor almost all through
the year. And in general they had to enforce all the decisions
of the court with regard to the times when sheep or cows should
be allowed in the meadow, when the sheep should come into the
“hatching ground,” how and where horses should be tethered,
and particularly to see that each tenant sowed his clover properly.
And when the hay in the meadow was ripe, they marked out to
each tenant the plots which fell to his share that year. It was
usual to re-elect one of the viewers, so that though there was
an annual election, each viewer held office for two years,
being for the first year the junior viewer, for the second the
senior.</p>

<p>There is much that is interesting in the management of the
sheep flock. From April 6th to September 18th the sheep fed
by day on the down, and were folded by night on the fallow field.
The fold began at the top of the field, and gradually worked
downwards, covering about half-an-acre every night, and so
manuring the whole. There being no other water supply on the
downs, all the tenants had to take turns to carry up water to fill
the water-troughs, and the viewers saw that they did so. On
September 18th the sheep came into the “hatching ground,”
on which, as we have seen, clover had been sown; and it is
noticeable that this crop, sown individually by each copyholder
on his own lands, was fed off by the common flock under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
supervision of the common shepherd. In winter the sheep
belonging to each tenant had to be folded separately; and the
doles and new closes were used for wintering the sheep. Some
made it a practice to sell off their flock when feed became scanty,
and to buy again the next spring; but the traditional custom was
to keep the sheep till they were four or five years old, at which
age they became fat, perhaps by superior cunning; meanwhile,
of course, they had been yielding wool and manure. In later
years, though every half living was entitled to forty sheep, by a
common agreement the number was limited to twenty-five in
spring, and later in the year to thirty-five, when the lambs
reached the age at which they were counted as sheep in the
calculation of common rights.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious feature in the local system of
agriculture was the management of the common meadow.
Sheep were allowed in it from March 1st to April 6th (it would
only bear ten or eleven), then they had to come out and join
the common flock, and the grass was let grow to hay. At hay
time the viewers went out and by the help of some almost
imperceptible ridges in the soil, and certain pegs driven into the
river banks, they marked out to each tenant the plots on which
he was allowed to cut and gather the hay. There were forty-seven
of these little plots; twenty-seven of them were definite
parts of particular copyholds, but nineteen were “changeable
allotments,” each of which belonged one year to one holding,
the next year to another, according to certain rules; while the
remaining allotment, a little three-cornered plot in the middle
called “100 Acres,” amounting perhaps to five perches in area,
was divided among the holders of the adjacent “Long lands.”
On July 6th, the hay having been carried, the cows came in,
and grazed in the meadow till November 23rd, and then the
meadow was watered.</p>

<p>About the agricultural merits of the whole system of managing
common fields, down and meadow, there is naturally a difference
of opinion. An old labourer says that before the old customs
began to decay “they made the most of everything,” that the
crops are not so good now, and “you can’t get the butter or the
cheese” which used to be produced. The butter nowadays goes
rancid immediately, and the cheese has no taste. On the other
hand, the enterprising young farmer who now holds the manor
farm at Stratton, who has himself been a “viewer,” says:
“They always had two crops,” <i>i.e.</i>, the corn crops had to
struggle with couch grass, which partly for want of sufficient
ploughing, and partly because it had a secure foothold in the
“walls,” was never properly got rid of.</p>

<p>That the life of the old system was gradually dying out before
it was ended by the extinction of the copyholds appears from two
circumstances: the old habit of mutual help in ploughing, one
tenant lending his horse to another, had died out; and the viewers
had difficulty in getting their expenses refunded. The wonder
is that its vitality was so persistent.</p>

<p>The history of the manors can be pretty fully traced by means
of the Court rolls, from 1649, when a Parliamentary survey was
held, to the present day. In 1649 Stratton had one copyhold
tenant holding a place and a-half, four holding one place each,
and ten holding half a place each, making 10½ “places” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
“livings” altogether. There were, besides, 12 copyholders who
each held a “customary cottage with thappurtenances.” During
the next two hundred years (from 1649 to 1838) the number
of “livings” diminished from 10½ to 9; the actual number of
holders of livings or half-livings diminished only from 15 to 14;
but the twelve “customary cottages with thappurtenances,”
which included one or two acres of arable land and corresponding
common rights, diminished to five “cotes.” The other
cottagers, however, retained the right of cutting as much furze
on certain “sleights” on the down, at any one time, as they
could carry home on their head and shoulders; and the total
number of cottagers was just two less in 1838 than in 1649.</p>

<p>The Court rolls contain, besides declarations of rights of the
manor to water from the stream, and to the allegiance of certain
residents outside, and a record of the changes in the tenantry,
the names of the officers elected, and regulations agreed upon
for the management of the land. Thus, there is usually some
regulation as to the length of the rope by which a horse may
be tethered in the common fields; mares are continually being
prohibited from being kept in common or common field; pigs
must not be allowed to stray; cow dung must not be removed
from the meadow, nor certain thorny bushes in the meadow be
cut, nor may ducks or geese be fed in it. The penalty for each
of these offences is a fine of <abbr title="5 shillings">5<i>s.</i></abbr> or <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> The neglect to carry
water up to the down for the sheep is another punishable offence.
In 1748 it was found that the sheep pond needed to be mended;
the viewers accordingly had to see to its repair, and penalties
were agreed upon for refusing to pay the proper share of the
cost.</p>

<p>Previous to 1765 the dates for, <i>e.g.</i>, turning cows into the
meadow or sheep into the “hatching ground” varied from year
to year; but the settlement then arrived at was maintained
for a succession of years. The jury</p>

</div>

<p>The year 1789 was a comparatively important date in the
agricultural history of Stratton during the eighteenth century.
At the Court held on October 9th, it was agreed that “the
tenants shall meet in the West Field on the 14th inst. between
9 and 10 in the morning, to bound out the several lands, and
afterwards each shall leave a lanchett of a furrow between his
and the adjoining land under penalty of a fine of <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> And no
tenant shall turn his plough on his neighbour’s land after the
21st of November.” It would appear that the scrupulous
observance of the “walls” dividing one man’s land from
another, which was such an exceptional feature of Stratton and
Grimstone Common Fields, dates from this meeting.</p>

<p>Fordington parish, until the extinction of the copyholds, had
many features which compare curiously with those of Stratton
and Grimstone. It is very much larger; for whereas Stratton
and Grimstone together have an area of only about 1200 acres,
the area of Fordington is 2749 acres, of which, up to 1876,
nearly 1800 acres was common field and common meadow, and
618 acres commons adjoining the common field. Fordington is
also peculiarly divided into three portions: the arable field and
common pastures lying immediately south of Dorchester, the
meadows forming a detached area by the side of the River
Frome, and the village itself a third detached area.</p>

<p>The copyholds in Fordington were known, some as “whole-places,”
“half-places,” as in Stratton and Grimstone, but
others as “farthing holds.” One cannot help asking what
were the original meanings of these terms, and how they are
related to the “virgates” of Domesday, and to the “yardlands”
of the Midlands, and the “broad” and “narrow oxgangs” of
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Concerning these terms it
appears to be established that a “yardland” or “virgate” was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
originally one quarter of a “carucate,” or ploughland, <i>i.e.</i>, the
amount of arable land (about 120 acres in average soil) which a
plough team of eight oxen could plough in a year, together with
its due share of meadow and common pasture. A broad oxgang
was about 24 acres of arable land, and therefore apparently the
northern representative of a yardland or virgate; and a narrow
oxgang was about 12 acres of arable, or half a broad oxgang.</p>

<p>In Stratton, as we have seen, every “whole place” or “whole
living” had common rights for two horses, four cows, and
eighty sheep; every half-place common rights for one horse,
two cows, and forty sheep. The areas of land attached to the
three whole places were respectively 18 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 3 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 35 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, 19 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 2 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 3 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>,
22 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 0 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 11 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, averaging just 20 acres; the half-places varied
from 9 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 0 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 19 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr> to 13 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 2 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 25 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, the smaller half-places
having an advantage in quality of soil, and the average being
almost exactly 11 acres.</p>

<p>In Grimstone the common rights as well as the area of land
belonging to particular whole or half-places varied somewhat.
The half-places consisted respectively of&mdash;</p>

<p>The “whole and a-quarter place” had 26 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 0 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 13 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr> of
land and rights for three horses, five cows, and 120 sheep,
and the “three-quarter place” 16 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 2 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, with rights for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
one horse, five cows, and eighty sheep. If these be added
together and divided by two we arrive at two whole places of
21 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 0 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 27 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, with the common rights for two horses,
five cows, and 100 sheep. This may be taken as the typical
whole place, and the half-place is just a little more than the
mathematical half of a whole place. The fact that the common
rights attached to a given unit were more extensive in Grimstone
than in Stratton is the natural consequence of the fact that
Grimstone had 244 acres of down and 35 acres of cow-common,
Stratton only 190 acres of down and 26 acres of cow-common.</p>

<p>But when we compare these with the whole places, half-places,
and farthing holds of Fordington, we find rather a
puzzling discrepancy. In the latter parish the fourteen whole
places each had, in 1841, the date of the Tithe Commutation,
rights for four horses, three cows, and 120 sheep, except
one, which had no common rights at all, but, apparently by
compensation, had 66 acres of arable land, eleven more than
any of the others. The smallest of the others had 42 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 3 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr>,
the largest 55 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 0 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 22 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, the average being about 48 acres;
in other words, in Fordington a whole place had more than
twice as much arable land as in Stratton or Grimstone, and
carried a common right for four horses instead of for two.</p>

<p>Each of the twenty-one half-places in Fordington had
common rights for three horses, two cows, and sixty-six sheep&mdash;which
more closely approximates to three-quarters than to a
half of the rights of a whole place. The area of land attached
to a half-place is, however, on the average somewhat less
than half that attached to a whole place, the largest having
25 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 6 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, the smallest 15 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 36 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, the average being
just under 21 acres. It happens curiously that the largest
“farthing holds” had more land than the smallest half-places,
as their areas range from 11 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 7 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr> to 17 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 3 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 35 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr> There
were nineteen of them, and their average area was 14½ acres.
Each had a common right for two horses, two cows, and forty
sheep.</p>

<p>The following tentative hypothesis may be suggested as an
explanation. It is based on the presumption that the <em>names</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
represent a more ancient set of circumstances than the actual
facts recorded in the tithe apportionment.</p>

<p>I think it, on the whole, more probable that these units of
holdings are based upon ploughing by horses than upon ploughing
by oxen. In other words, I think that the system of
co-aration persisted unimpaired in these particular villages after
horses had superseded oxen for ploughing purposes, which
might have happened at a very early date. This seems plainly
indicated by the fact that during the 190 years from 1649
to 1839 the majority of the copyholders in Stratton and Grimstone
had only one horse apiece, therefore they must have
combined to work even a two-horse plough; and, as I have said
above, the practice of helping one another with horses for
ploughing only died out in very recent years.</p>

<p>I think further, that in all three manors, a “whole place” or
“whole living” meant the land cultivated by one plough, but
that in Stratton and Grimstone the plough was a light and
shallow one drawn by two horses only, and in Fordington a
heavier plough drawn by four horses. The soil in Stratton and
Grimstone is very thin and stony, and would not bear deep
ploughing; that of Fordington is much deeper and heavier.
Further, Stratton and Grimstone fields lie on the steep slopes
descending from the downs; Fordington field is gently undulating.
Therefore, a four-horse plough in Fordington would
plough more than twice as much land as a two-horse plough in
the other villages. A whole place then in Fordington naturally
would have common rights for four horses; in Stratton and
Grimstone for two horses only.</p>

<p>A half-place in Stratton and Grimstone was, therefore, the
holding allotted to the tenant who had one horse, and it carried
a common right for one horse. Though a half-place in Fordington
carried in 1841 a common right for three horses, I am
inclined to believe that it originally was the holding of a tenant
who had two horses, <i>i.e.</i>, half a plough team, and originally had
a common right for two horses only; and, similarly, though a
farthing hold in 1841 had a common right for two horses, I am
inclined to think it originally was the share of the man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
one horse only, and only carried a common right for one horse.
That is to say, I think the <em>names</em> here a better guide than the
nineteenth century common rights. If one were to adopt the
opposite view on this point, one would infer that a “half-place”
was a misnomer for a “three-quarter place,” and was
the allotment of the man who had three horses, and that a
“farthing hold” should properly be called a half-place. But
on this assumption it would be hard to explain the fact that
the arable land attached to a half-place is, on the average,
a little less than half that attached to a whole place, and
that attached to a farthing hold only a little more than one
quarter.</p>

<p>It seems quite probable that when in the course of the
gradual improvement of horses and ploughs in Fordington, the
stage was reached at which three horses were sufficient for a
plough, the holders of half-places already possessing two horses
each endeavoured to emancipate themselves from the necessity
of joint-ploughing, by obtaining an additional horse; and that
when they had generally succeeded in this they obtained the
right of pasturing three horses each on the commons and
common-field; and when a two-horse plough had come into
general use, the holders of farthing holds would naturally take
similar steps, and so acquire common rights for two horses
each.</p>

<p>There is one other noteworthy fact with regard to Fordington
revealed by the Tithe Apportionment. Certain lands scattered
over the fields of a total area of 4 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 2 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 20 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr> were the property
of the parish constable for the time being; the churchwardens
similarly held 1 <abbr title="rood">r.</abbr> 7 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, the parish hayward 1 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 3 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 18 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr>, and
the parish reeve 3 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 0 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 17 <abbr title="perches">p.</abbr> These ancient village offices
were therefore in Fordington not entirely unremunerated.<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a></p>

<p class="mini_gap_above">We have therefore the assurance of the Copyhold, Inclosure
and Tithe Commission that in the year 1873 common fields
existed in 905 parishes of England and Wales, of a total area of
166,953 acres, and that there was reasonable ground for inferring
the existence of 97,354 acres of common field land, scattered
presumably over some four or five hundred more parishes; in other
words, that about one parish in every ten in England and Wales
presented an example of the medieval system of land holding
and cultivation similar, though as a rule on a smaller scale, to
the survivals described above.</p>

<p>The statement is amazing, and would be received with
incredulity by anyone familiar with the rural districts of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
county of England, so far as it relates to that county. The
Commission invites our suspicion of its statistics. The main
purpose of the return was to give the acreage of surviving
commons; these are estimated at 2,368,465 acres. As late as
1871, however, the Commission had declared, on the basis of an
estimate made in 1843, that 8,000,000 acres of commons still
existed, and 1,000,000 acres of common field or meadow. A
little scrutiny of some details confirms one’s suspicions.</p>

<p>Thus, to take a single county, Kent has from the early days
of the enclosure controversy been famous as a well enclosed
county. The author of the “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Discourse of the Common weal of
this Realm of England</cite>” mentions “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">those countries that be
most inclosed, as essex, kent, devenshire</span>” (1549). Skipping
two and a-half centuries, we find the reporter of the Board of
Agriculture in 1793 declaring that such a thing as a common
field did not exist in Kent.<a name="Anchor_8" id="Anchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> We are confirmed in our acceptance
of this statement by finding that there have been no enclosures
in Kent of common fields by Act of Parliament, either before
1793 or since. Yet the return gives Kent twenty-one parishes
having common fields of an ascertained area of about 4183
acres. It therefore is necessary to criticise the methods by
which the figures in the return were arrived at.</p>

<p>They are based on the tithe maps, the Commissioners
remarking that “the common field lands are generally distinguishable
by the particular manner in which they are marked
on the Tithe maps, and their area has been estimated from
those maps.” The Tithe Commission was appointed in 1836
(<cite>6 &amp; 7 <abbr title="William the fourth">Will. IV.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 71</cite>), and the tithe maps and apportionments
were made mostly before 1850; we are told “the total area
embraced by the Tithe Documents is 28,195,903 acres. The
total area of the remaining parishes is 8,961,270 acres.”</p>

<p>In order, therefore, for the Commission to have obtained a
correct result, it was necessary&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) that the common field lands should have been <em>rightly</em>
distinguished from other lands;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) that their area should have been <em>rightly</em> estimated;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) that due allowance should have been made for enclosures
between the date of the tithe apportionment and the date of the
return;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) that the area of common field in the parishes for which
there are no tithe maps should have been estimated on correct
principles.</p>

<p>Not one of these conditions was satisfied.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Taking these in reverse order, it is assumed in calculating
the area of common fields in parishes that have no tithe maps,
that they have the same ratio of common field to other land as
those which have tithe maps. This principle is entirely wrong
for two reasons: (1) because Private Enclosure Acts usually
arranged for tithe commutation, so that parishes enclosed by
such Acts before 1830 are ordinarily among those without tithe
maps&mdash;and equally among those without common fields; and
(2) the existence of unenclosed common fields would be a reason
for demanding a commutation of tithe. The importance of this
may be shown by taking Bedfordshire as a test case. For sixty-eight
Bedfordshire parishes there are no tithe maps, and the
Commission estimates that these sixty-eight parishes have
12,925 acres of common fields. But sixty-six out of these
sixty-eight parishes were enclosed by Private Acts, leaving two
parishes only, of a combined area of 3578 acres, in which a
survival of common field might reasonably be deemed possible,
though even in these extremely improbable. Instead of 12,925
acres of common field for this part of the county, the only
reasonable estimate would be 0.</p>

<p>Similar statements might be made with regard to any other
county which was mainly enclosed by Act of Parliament, as
Northampton, to which 13,446 acres of common field are
attributed to the non-tithe map parishes; Lincoln, to which
10,823 acres are similarly attributed; Berkshire, with 2705
acres; Buckingham, with 2365 acres; Cambridge, with 2678
acres; Huntingdon, with 2336 acres; Nottingham, with 6617
acres; Oxford, with 4839 acres; Rutland, with 5726 acres, and
the East Riding of Yorkshire, with 7359 acres. For this cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
alone by far the greater part of the 97,354 acres added on to the
total estimated from tithe maps must be rejected, and of course
any error of over-statement that we find with regard to parishes
which have tithe maps will still further reduce the remainder.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Due allowance has not been made for enclosure between
the date of the tithe apportionment and the date of the return.
It is of course very difficult to say how this could have been
done without an elaborate and expensive local enquiry, so far as
relates to enclosure without Parliamentary authority. As a
matter of fact, no allowance at all has been made for this sort of
enclosure. This is justifiable; but at least a general statement
should have been made to the effect that a very large deduction
had to be made on this account in order to obtain a correct idea
of the position. Further, great carelessness was shown even in
allowing for Parliamentary enclosures subsequent to the tithe
apportionment. Thus, to take one glaring instance, 1500 acres
of common field are credited to Beddington and Wallington,
near Croydon, in Surrey. These common fields were enclosed
by an Act dated 1850, and the award, dated 1853, was at the
time of the return deposited with the Copyhold, Inclosure, and
Tithe Commission.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) But it is in distinguishing the common fields and
in estimating their area from the tithe maps that the worst
mistakes have been made. The Commission says that “the
common fields are generally distinguishable by the particular
manner in which they are marked on the tithe maps.” From a
comparison of a good many tithe maps with the figures given in
the return, I infer that those to whom the duty of distinguishing
the common fields was entrusted, were told that areas divided
into sub-divisions on the maps by means of dotted lines were
common fields. These dotted lines indicate a division of ownership
marked by some slight boundary and not by a hedge. They
might indicate allotments, for example, or a number of other local
circumstances, besides common fields. The statements that
4183 acres of common field were to be found in Kent, and
13,439 acres in Wales, being specially in direct contradiction of
all other evidence that I had collected, I tested these by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
instances. In Kent 1400 acres were assigned to the parish of
Northbourne. By a close examination of the tithe map I could
find nothing indicating any common field at all; the only excuse
for the statement was a few dotted lines, which by a reference
to the Award were proved to indicate only that some fields were
inadequately hedged. For Wales, I got out the map and award
for Llanerlyl, in Montgomery, credited with 1675 acres of common
field. Here there was something to be found on the map looking
exactly like common field, but the Award showed that these
dotted strips of land were “turbaries.”</p>

<p>We have seen that the open field parish in its perfection, as
Castor and Ailesworth before enclosure, possessed common
arable fields, common meadows, common pasture, and frequently
commonable waste, like Ailesworth Heath. Where the
parish as a whole becomes enclosed without an Act of Parliament,
particularly if the enclosure is gradual, the waste
frequently remains common. Thus we have the numerous
commons of Kent, Surrey, and other counties. Less frequently,
but still in a considerable number of cases, the common meadows
remain open commonable and unenclosed. Port Meadow at
Oxford is a familiar instance. These common meadows are
included in the return under consideration among the common
fields. Thus, for instance, the surprise with which one receives
the information that Tottenham, in 1873, had 300 acres of
common fields, disappears when it is perceived that the marshes
along the River Lea are meant.</p>

<p>It will also be noticed later on that in parishes where the
common field system has disappeared for generations, there are
frequently still remaining in the midst of enclosed fields strips
of land of different ownership from the rest of the field, but let
to the same farmer, and without any visible demarcation. Such
fields in Wales and the north-west of England are called
“quilleted fields.” The tithe map records, with its dotted lines,
the area and position of the “quillets.” Such fields are included
under “common fields” in this return.</p>

<p>In at least the great majority of cases where the supposed
common fields are small, it is probable that nothing more notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
than quilleted fields existed at the time the tithe map was made;
and even this survival would, in most cases, have disappeared
since. Out of the 905 alleged cases of common fields, in 670
cases the areas given are under 100 acres.</p>

<p>In fine, this return of commons and common fields, which
gives such a fair promise of numerous surviving common fields,
in reality gives little assistance, because there is but the
remotest probability in any particular case that those common
fields exist. The probability is sufficient in some cases to
encourage one to make local enquiries, but these enquiries
nearly always end in disappointment. The following cases in
which common arable fields theoretically survive, are chiefly
interesting as illustrating the phenomena of the decay of the
common field system in villages where it has not died a sudden
death through enclosure. I omit the case of Hitchin, made
famous by Mr. F. Seebohm.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap" id="herts">Clothall (Herts).</h3>

<p>Clothall is a parish lying on the north slope of the chalk
hills of Hertfordshire, just off the Great North Road, which passes
through the adjoining parish of Baldock. Approaching it from
the south, one gradually ascends the long slope from Hertford,
and suddenly at the summit has before one a far-stretching
view over the flat country of Bedfordshire and adjoining counties.
The road descends steeply and passes through the Clothall
common fields. At the time of my visit the harvest (of barley)
was being gathered in; the arrangement of the field was clearly
visible. The long, narrow strips of stubble, never quite straight,
and never quite of uniform width, were divided by “balks” of
grass, grown tall and gone to seed. Each balk was reduced
to as narrow dimensions as it could be, without endangering
its continued existence, for the sake of separating one strip from
another. A view of this field is shown in <cite>Mr. Seebohm’s
“English Village Community.”</cite></p>

<p>But there is in Clothall the husk only, and no surviving
kernel of the English village community. The whole of the
field, estimated at about 600 acres, is let to a single farmer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
who cultivates it on modern principles, but who is bound to
preserve the balks. There are but three owners of land in the
field. Fifty-six acres are glebe, the remainder belongs in
alternate strips to the lord of the manor (the Marquis of
Salisbury) and to a gentleman to whom possession passed by
marriage, from a family which had been engaged in brewing.
The land is famous for barley, and the owner of a local brewery
in the early or middle part of the nineteenth century gradually
bought up nearly all the land in the common field that did not
belong to the lord of the manor. Application was made in 1885
to the Board of Agriculture for enclosure, the manorial authorities
and the vicar both desiring it, but the other owner objected.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that the villagers still hold to the
tradition that they have rights of common upon the balks, a
tradition which is probably well founded. But they dare not
attempt to exercise those rights. An enclosure here, accompanied
by the provision of ground for allotments and recreation,
would be a boon for the villagers; and it would probably pay
the landowners to get rid of those balks, which are as great a
nuisance agriculturally as they are interesting from an
antiquarian point of view.</p>

<p>The counties of Hertford and Bedford have been, in recent years,
particularly rich in survivals of common field, for the enclosure of
Totternhoe (<a href="#Page_63" title="Go to page 63.">p. 63</a>) was only completed in 1891; Yelden had a
common field of about 600 acres up till about the year 1881,
when the chief proprietor, by buying out or compensating all
the other proprietors or owners of common rights, obtained
exclusive ownership of the unenclosed land; and at Studham
and Renhold similar voluntary enclosures were carried out under
the pressure of the chief landowners within the memory of
old inhabitants. Fragments of commonable pasture in three
different parts of Renhold parish, and a common of about 60
acres in Studham, remain as memorials.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Bygrave and Wallington.</h3>

<p>Beneath the long sloping hillside of Clothall lies the little town
of Baldock, adjoining Letchworth and the “Garden City”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
and on the other side of Baldock is the parish of Bygrave; which
is, like Clothall, still unenclosed, and for the same reason; the
Marquis of Salisbury being here again the lord of the manor, and
the other Clothall proprietor the next largest landowner. But in
Bygrave the farms, as well as the properties, are very much
intermixed. Here and there there are grassy balks between
adjacent properties; and in places the growth of bushes on these
has almost made them into hedges, but as a rule there is no
boundary between strips belonging to different holdings and
different properties. A road through the open fields at one
point cuts off the end of a strip of land belonging to Lord
Salisbury from the rest of that strip; it forms a triangular plot
too small to repay the trouble of bringing the plough across the
road to plough it; and the men who hold the adjoining land
revere the rights of property too much to touch it; it therefore
remains a refuge for all manner of weeds.</p>

<p>As in Clothall, no common rights are exercised over the
common fields of Bygrave by the poor of the parish, nor could I
hear of any tradition of rights belonging to the poor or to
cottagers. But the different occupiers of land in the common
fields have, and exercise, the right of shackage, <i>i.e.</i>, of grazing
cattle after harvest, over one another’s holdings. And the lord
of the manor has a special right of “sheep-walk” over the
whole, for a month, from the first week in May and October.
This right is let with one of the farms. It is not actually
exercised, because the other occupiers of lands in the open
field buy exemption.</p>

<p>The hamlet of Luffenhall, also near Clothall, has “shack
lands” held under similar conditions.</p>

<p>The next parish to Clothall on the east, Wallington, is also
unenclosed. It has a small common on which cottagers have
the right to keep a cow and a calf, but so far as the rest of the
parish is concerned, the only surviving feature of the externals
of the common field system is the wide, breezy stretch of open
land, under wheat, roots and grass; and of the spirit of the
“village community” there is nothing. There are but two
farms; the wages paid are only <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="12 shillings">12<i>s.</i></abbr> per week. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
wages, so near London, naturally fail to keep the labourers in
the village; and the population is now (1903) less than 100,
though the church has seats for 260. As the men go, more and
more land is laid down in grass, and machinery is more and more
used; the absence of hedges of course facilitates the use of
certain kinds of agricultural machinery. The unenclosed parish
of Wallington, in fact, represents in an extreme degree the
triumph of all those tendencies against which the opponents of
enclosure waged war&mdash;great farms, absolute dependence of the
labourer, low wages, rural depopulation.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Sutton (Northamptonshire).</h3>

<p>The parish of Castor, or Caister, includes, besides the hamlets
of Castor and Ailesworth, the enclosure of which has been
described, the townships of Sutton and Upton. Sutton had
not at the time of the enclosure of Castor and Ailesworth
been legally enclosed, and the parish is described from the
tithe map as consisting of 450 acres of common field and
150 acres of common, out of a total of 888 acres. The vicar,
who had bought nearly all the land in the parish, and also the
manorial rights, in 1899 applied for an Act of Enclosure, which
he obtained in 1901. There were in Sutton certain lands
belonging to the township, intermixed with those in private
ownership. The rents of these were paid with the poor rates.
Up till 1880 the two farmers who between them occupied nearly
the whole of the cultivated land, used to confer every year and
agree upon their course of tillage. They were then persuaded
by the vicar to disentangle their farms, and cultivate them in
the ordinary way. At that time there ceased to be in Sutton
any visible sign of any exceptional features in the system of
landownership. The lands belonging to the township are
recorded in the tithe map, and their measurement in the
tithe award, but no balks to mark them are preserved.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the vicar of Sutton for the following
illustration of the possible evils of the common field system.
It occurred in a parish where he had formerly been resident,
which he did not name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>In this parish two adjacent strips of land were occupied
respectively by a farmer and a shoemaker. The farmer, who
was a careful and diligent cultivator, having well manured
and laboured his strip, sowed it with wheat, and as harvest
approached saw the prospect of an exceptionally good crop. The
shoemaker left his strip entirely untouched. But when the
farmer was about to begin to reap, the shoemaker intervened,
and claimed that the strip which was cultivated was his, and the
untilled strip belonged to the farmer. The field jury was summoned,
and the extreme positiveness and assurance of the
shoemaker carried the day, and the shoemaker reaped the wheat.
The farmer then begged his successful adversary for some compensation
for his lost labour and expense, but was told that he
might consider himself lucky not to be prosecuted for trespass.
The farmer then proceeded to make the best of his bad bargain,
and set to work to plough up the weeds and thistles that covered
the strip of land awarded him. But as he ploughed he continually
turned up pieces of leather, corners wasted in cutting
out “uppers,” and other refuse of a shoemaker’s workshop.
These he collected and brought before the field jury. The
previous decision was then reversed and the shoemaker was
compelled to make restitution to the man he had wronged.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Elmstone Hardwicke (Gloucester).</h3>

<p>Elmstone Hardwicke is an extremely interesting example of
the common field system in a state of natural decay. Very
nearly the whole parish belongs to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners,
but the holdings are intermixed and in small parcels,
over a large part, perhaps 1000 acres, of the parish, the farms
having been granted on leases of three lives. The farmers would
be glad to consolidate their holdings and enclose, but the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners effectually discourage this, as
I was told, by exorbitant demands for increase of rent. On
the other hand, I was informed that the Commissioners themselves
desired to enclose, but did not care for the expense of
proceeding by Act of Parliament, and they were endeavouring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
obtain their object by refusing to “re-life,” in order that the
leases might fall in, and be converted into leases for short terms
that might be made to terminate simultaneously. Thus an old
farmer who had a lease of 60 acres in 100 different parcels
scattered over the common fields, informed me of the negotiations
that had been entered into with him. He was by no means
disposed to readily part with his lease, as he had two good lives
remaining, both being his nephews, one aged 40 and the other
50. “They’ll both mak’ ’ighty,” he said, that being his own
age, though he looked a score of years younger.</p>

<p>This one farmer still (in 1899) followed what had been the
customary course of cultivation for the parish&mdash;a four years
course of wheat, beans, wheat, fallow; this being a modification of
a still earlier course of wheat, beans, barley, fallow, the soil being
more suitable to wheat than to barley. The other farmers followed
no fixed rule, each one cultivating his farm as he chose, subject,
however, to the right that was still recognised and exercised,
that each occupier could turn horses, cattle and sheep on to the
common fields after harvest until the first of November. In consequence
of the abandonment of the traditional course of cultivation
the common use of the fallow-field has been dropped by
general consent, for the last forty or fifty years. The institution
of the field jury has also disappeared; though the above-mentioned
old farmer still posts the notices declaring the fields open or
closed, and so may be said to fill the post of “foreman of the
fields,” he does so by right of inheritance rather than of
election, in succession to his father.</p>

<p>Various controversies have arisen recently in Elmstone Hardwicke
with regard to the rights of various persons interested.
I have referred above to the case of the farmer who, in the
spring of 1899, occupying a “headland” in the common fields
on which various strips belonging to his neighbours abutted,
instead of following the customary practice and waiting to plough
till the last, ploughed his headland before the abutting lands
were ploughed, and then sued for damages when his neighbours
turned their ploughs on his land.</p>

<p>Another farmer who occupied a very small holding in Elmstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Hardwicke, and a much larger holding in an adjoining parish,
made a practice of turning great numbers of sheep on the
Elmstone Hardwicke common fields in the open time, which he
was able to keep in the close time on his other land. The
question arose whether this unfair procedure was lawful. The
coming into force of the <cite>Parish Councils Act of 1894</cite> also had
the effect of suggesting enquiries into the claims of labourers to
share in common-right privileges.</p>

<p>The vicar, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George Bayfield Roberts, accordingly
obtained the opinion of Sir Walter Phillimore on the subject.
It was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As far as I can gather from the facts laid before me, I think
that every freeholder and copyholder has a right to turn cattle
upon every part of the common field, and that the right is not
confined to the particular field or part of the common field in
which he holds land.</p>

<p>“This right passes to the tenant or occupier under each freeholder
or copyholder. The tenant, or occupier, has it, not in
his own right but merely as claiming under his landlord.</p>

<p>“I know of no rule of law which would give this right to
farmers as such, and deny it to cottagers as such, if the latter
have holdings on which they can keep their beasts during close
time. But the right to turn on to Lammas lands (as this common
field is) can only be exercised in respect of beasts used in the
cultivation or manuring of the holding in respect of which the
claim is made (<cite><i>Baylis</i> v. <i>Tyssen-Amhurst</i>, Law Reports 6 Ch. D.
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 500</cite>).</p>

<p>“As the cottagers are said to be tenants of the farmers, the
latter can make it clear in all future lettings that they do not
let with the cottages the right to pasture in the common field.</p>

<p>“(2) The tenant of the Barn farm should keep his land
unenclosed during open time, and anyone who has a right to
turn on cattle can sue him if he obstructs (<cite><i>Stoneham</i> v. <i>London
and Brighton Railway Co.</i>, Law Reports 7 Q. B. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1</cite>), or can
pull down the fencing (<cite id="AvE"><i>Arlett</i> v. <i>Ellis</i>, 7 B. &amp; C. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 346</cite>).</p>

<p>“(2a). I do not think it would be wise to pull down a whole
fence, or sue for the damage caused by the fence, if substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and easy openings were made during open time. But there is
some authority for saying that the whole fence must be
removed (<cite><i>Arlett</i> v. <i>Ellis</i>, <a href="#AvE" title="See citation above">cited above</a></cite>).</p>

<p>“(3) The only <i>locus standi</i> for the Parish Meeting is, if it has
been given by the County Council all the powers of a Parish
Council under <cite>section 19, sub-section 10, of the Local Government
Act, 1894 (56 &amp; 57 <abbr title="Victoria">Vict.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 73)</cite>, to apply to the Board of
Agriculture under <cite>section 9 of the Commons Act, 1876 (39 &amp; 40
<abbr title="Victoria">Vict.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 56)</cite>.</p>

<p>“This power is given to Parish Councils by <cite>section 8, sub-section
c, of the Local Government Act, 1894</cite>.</p>

<p>“<cite>Section 9 of the Commons Act, 1876</cite>, enables the Inclosure
Commissioners (whose place is now taken by the Board of
Agriculture) to give information and direction ‘upon application’
in order to bring about ‘the regulation of Commons’; and for
this purpose Lammas lands are included as Commons, as they
also came under the Inclosure Acts.</p>

<p>“By <cite>section 3</cite> a Provisional Order made by the Board for
‘regulation’  may provide for the ‘adjustment of rights,’  and
<cite>section 4</cite> shows how much can be done upon such an adjustment.”</p>

<p>This opinion was given in March, 1897. The very significant
passage which pointed out that since the cottagers held their
cottages from the farmers, they could not effectively claim any
rights which the farmers did not choose to grant them, threw
cold water on the agitation.</p>

<p>Elmstone Hardwicke is apparently another case in which
something would be gained and nothing lost by an Act of
Enclosure.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Ewelme (Oxfordshire).</h3>

<p>Rather more than half this parish, near Wallingford, is
legally in the condition of open common fields, and there is
besides a very extensive “cow-common” on which is a golf
course. The neighbouring parishes of Bensington<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> and Berwick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Salome had until 1852 common fields which were in part intermixed
with those of Ewelme, and there were commons commonable
to all three parishes. In 1852 an Act was passed which
was carried into effect in 1863 for the enclosure of Bensington
and Berwick Salome, and the parts of Ewelme which were intermixed
with these. Ewelme is owned by a number of small
proprietors who chiefly farm their own land. These made a
voluntary division,<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> but they still enjoy certain rights of common
and of shooting over one another’s land. No labourers enjoy
rights of common.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>There are two significant facts about this parish.</p>

<p>In the first place, one particular farm enjoys a special right of
pasturing sheep on the cow-common, not shared by other farms.
This is significant when taken into consideration with the facts
for Cambridgeshire and elsewhere related below.</p>

<p>Secondly, this gives a typical instance of the effect of enclosure
of <em>commonable waste</em> on the poor. One of the commons enclosed
was known as the “Furze Common,” and it supplied the poor of
the neighbourhood with their fuel, for <em>every</em> inhabitant had the
right of cutting furze on it. After enclosure the Furze Common
was allotted to one man, who allowed no trespass on it, and the
<em>owners</em> of cottages were awarded allotments of land in consideration
of rights which the <em>cottagers</em> had exercised. The lands so
allotted became part of ordinary farms, and the poor simply lost
their supply of fuel without any compensation whatever. This
was done under the sanction, not of an Enclosure Act rushed
through Parliament before 1845, but of the Enclosure Commissioners,
appointed expressly to prevent any injury to the class
least able to guard its own interests, as well as to facilitate
enclosure.</p>

<h2 title="V. THE ISLE OF AXHOLME" id="chapter_5"><span class="sh_cont">CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="sub_head">THE ISLE OF AXHOLME.</span></h2>

<p>To catch the spirit of the common field system, to see that
system no mere historical survival, but developing in harmony
with modern needs, one must go to the Isle of Axholme. Starting
from Doncaster eastwards, through somewhat devious roads, one
descends gradually to a wide belt of reclaimed fen. Between
this fen on the west, and the river Trent with more fen on the
east, is a ridge of low hills, comprising the four large parishes
of Haxey, Epworth, Belton and Owston. These constitute the
Isle of Axholme&mdash;an island, indeed, up to the time of the great
drainage operations of Vermuyden in the reign of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> It
was, no doubt, a very ancient home of fishermen and fowlers, who
gradually brought the island itself into cultivation, using the
plough as a subsidiary means of subsistence. The strenuous
opposition offered by the people of Axholme to the work of the
Dutch engineer is well known. Even after they were beaten,
and the greatest drainage scheme of the seventeenth century was
carried through, the four Axholme parishes retained extensive
fens, used as common pastures.</p>

<p>When in the eighteenth century the great trade of driving
Scotch cattle to the London market, in which Sir Walter Scott’s
grandfather was a pioneer, sprang up, the route followed diverged
from the great north road in Yorkshire, in order to avoid turnpikes,
and the cattle, grazing as they slowly plodded southwards,
and fattening on the roadsides, came through Selby, Snaith and
the Isle of Axholme. To protect their fields the islanders
hedged them along the roadsides, leaving only narrow thoroughfares;
then, to make these thoroughfares passable for themselves,
they laid down for footpath a stone pavement which still exists
for twenty miles. But the old hedges have in many places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
disappeared, so that the fields lie open to the road; and in
particular, the gates which then guarded every entrance to the
fields are now generally represented by gaps.</p>

<p>At the end of the eighteenth century by far the greater part
of the island proper was in the condition of open arable fields,
with properties and holdings intermixed, as in the open fields of
Laxton; though near each village there were enclosed gardens,
and closes of pasture. It would appear that the original system
of cultivation was a four-year course of husbandry, so that one-fourth
of the arable land was at any time fallow, and used as
common pasture, and common rights were exercised on two of
the other three-fourths after harvest; one-fourth probably being
under turnips. On the margin of the hill there were perhaps
commonable meadows, though I cannot trace them. Beyond,
the common fens and marshes, used mainly for grazing horned
cattle, extended over an area of about 14,000 acres.</p>

<p>Arthur Young visited the island at this time, and thus
describes it:</p>

<p>“In respect of property, I know nothing more singular
respecting it (the County of Lincoln), than its great division in
the Isle of Axholm. In most of the towns there, for it is not
quite general, there is much resemblance of some rich parts of
France and Flanders. The inhabitants are collected in villages
and hamlets; and almost every house you see, except very poor
cottages on the borders of commons, is inhabited by a farmer,
the proprietor of his farm, of from four or five, and even fewer,
to 20, 40, and more acres, scattered about the open fields, and
cultivated with all that minutiae of care and anxiety, by the
hands of the family, which are found abroad, in the countries
mentioned. They are very poor respecting money, but very
happy respecting their mode of existence. Contrivance, mutual
assistance, by barter and hire, enable them to manage these
little farms, though they break all rules of rural proportion. A
man will keep a pair of horses that has but 3 or 4 acres by
means of vast commons and working for hire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>“The enclosure of these commons will lessen their numbers
and vastly increase the quantity of products at market. Their
cultivated land being of uncommon fertility, a farm of 20 acres
supports a family very well, as they have, generally speaking, no
fallows, but an endless succession of corn, potatoes, flax,
beans, etc. They do nearly all their work themselves, and are
passionately fond of buying a bit of land. Though I have said
they are happy, yet I should note that it was remarked to me,
that the little proprietors work like Negroes, and do not live so
well as the inhabitants of the poor-house; but all is made
amends for by possessing land.”<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p>

<p>In 1795 the chief landowners took steps to obtain an Act for
enclosing all four parishes. There were stronger reasons for
enclosing than in the majority of the East Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire parishes all around, in which Parliamentary
enclosure was being pushed furiously on, for the fens were
capable of enormous improvement. But in the Isle of Axholme
it was not possible for the chief landowners to overbear the
opposition of the villagers. One peculiar feature of the locality
was that every cottage had a common right, and there were no
rights attached to land apart from cottages. This fact, and the
peculiarly wide distribution of property, caused the decision to
rest with the peasantry. They raised no objection to the
division and drainage of the marshes, perceiving that their
allotments would be far more valuable after drainage than their
common rights before; so this part of the scheme was generally
agreed to. But on the question of the enclosure of the arable
fields they were not complacent. They saw that the expense
of hedging a small allotment would be heavy, and the injury done
by the hedge to a small plot, of say 1 or 2 acres, by shading the land
and sheltering it from the wind would more than counterbalance
the advantage of having that holding in one piece instead of in
two or three, to say nothing of the loss of the space given up to
hedges. They also probably feared that the arable land, if
enclosed, would largely be laid down to grass, and so the benefit
of an increased demand for labour and higher wages promised
by the enclosure of the marshes would be lost, at least in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
degree, through the enclosure of the fields. Accordingly the
necessary consent of a “three-fourths majority in number and
value” of the owners was not obtained, and the proposal to
enclose was defeated. It would appear that all the educated,
intelligent, and influential people did their best to overcome
this “ignorant prejudice.” But on the other hand there were
the votes of all those cottagers who did not as yet possess strips
in the common fields, but who hoped to be able to purchase them.
They saw that while thousands of acres of land lay immediately
round the villages in acre, half-acre, and rood strips, there was a
chance of buying one, and so taking the first upward step from
the rank of the landless labourer. On enclosure those strips
would give place to closes of at least several acres each, and the
closes would be quite out of their reach. Blind, obstinate,
wilful, and prejudiced as the villagers seemed to their betters,
the event shows that they were entirely accurate in their view of
the situation.</p>

<p>Arthur Young’s account of these proceedings is as follows:
“In the Isle of Axholm there is an immense inclosure on the
point of beginning, the Act and survey having been passed of no
less than 12,000 acres of commons in the four parishes of Haxey,
Hepworth, Belton, and Owston. I passed these commons in
various quarters, and rode purposely to view some parts; they
are in a wretched and unprofitable state, but valued, if inclosed,
in the ideas of the islanders at <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> or <abbr title="11 shillings">11<i>s.</i></abbr> an acre.</p>

<p>“<em>Cottage rights are claims, but lands without a cottage have
none.</em> It was a barbarous omission that when the Act was
procured they resisted a clause to divide the open arable fields
subject to rights of common. But they have here, by a custom,
a right of inclosure which is singular; every man that pleases
may enclose his own open field land notwithstanding the rights
of common upon it while open; and accordingly many do it
when, by purchase, they get five or six acres together, of which
I saw many examples.” (<cite>“Agricultural Survey of Lincolnshire,”
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 79</cite>.)</p>

<p>Somewhat later a second attempt was made in the parish of
Owston to obtain an enclosure with partial success. Three of
the four fields were divided and enclosed: but the same motives
which prevented the enclosure of the four parishes at the previous
attempt were strong enough to secure that one field should
remain open. It was in 1811, I was locally informed, that the
Owston Enclosure took place. I can find no record of the Act.</p>

<p>As we saw above, the old system (probably a four-field course)
of cultivation had dropped into disuse even before the beginning
of the nineteenth century, but still, up to about the year 1850,
the custom remained that on one of the four fields, that under
wheat, after the crops had been carried, the “Pindar” gave
notice that “the fields are to be broken,” and over that field
common rights of pasture were exercised for about a month,
from some day in October to Martinmas (November 23rd).
Then the Pindar kept watch over the grazing animals night and
day, and by night built up enormous bonfires, with all the boys
of the village clustering round and roasting potatoes.</p>

<p>But about 1850 even this custom disappeared, and now every
holder of lands in the open fields cultivates them as he chooses,
but they must be under some form of tillage as long as they
remain open. But the tendency, observed by Arthur Young,
for the larger owners of lands in the common fields to buy, sell
and exchange strips with other owners with the object of
getting some half-dozen acres in one continuous piece and then
enclosing them, has continued up to the present day. Such
enclosures are laid down in grass, and in this way the area of
the open fields has gradually been reduced.</p>

<p>The strips of land in the open fields are known as “selions,”
the auctioneers’ notices of a sale reading, “All that selion piece
of land,” etc. They are also known as “acres,” “half-acres,”
“roods,” etc., but these terms must not be taken as exactly
defining their area. A nominal acre varies in area from a
minimum of about half an acre to a maximum of an acre and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
half. As the half-acres and roods similarly vary, it follows that
the largest “half-acres” are bigger than the smallest “acres.”</p>

<p>The general aspect of the fields is well shown in the photograph
taken for me by Mr. Newbit, of Epworth. I asked in a
bar-parlour in Haxey, “Are these allotments both sides of the
road?” A labourer answered, “Yes, but there are seven miles
of these allotments.” But the publican corrected him. “Well,
it’s not allotments exactly, it’s <em>a very old system</em>, that’s what it
is.” Further conversation with one man and another gave me
a strong impression that the people of Axholme are proud of
their “very old system.” That they have some reason to be
proud of it Mr. Rider Haggard bears witness:</p>

<p>“The Isle of Axholme is one of the few places I have visited
in England which may be called, at any rate in my opinion,
truly prosperous in an agricultural sense, the low price of
produce notwithstanding, chiefly because of its assiduous
cultivation of the potato.”<a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a></p>

<p>Axholme may be described as a district of allotments, cultivated,
and in great part owned, by a working peasantry. The
“assiduous cultivation of the potato” is rather an indication of
the real strength of Axholme agriculture, than a true explanation
of it. At the time of Arthur Young’s visit, the isle was noted
for the cultivation of flax and hemp; and this continued to be a
feature of the local agriculture till about thirty or forty years
ago, when the “assiduous cultivation of the potato” succeeded
it. Now, as Mr. Rider Haggard notices, experiments are carried
on with celery. The small holders, I was assured on all sides,
cultivate the land much more thoroughly than large farmers do
their farms, and the very look of the crops confirmed this
eloquently, even to my unskilled observation. Mr. Rider
Haggard quotes a local expert, Mr. William Standring, as
saying, “Wheat crops in the isle <em>averaged seven quarters</em> (56
bushels) an acre, the oats nine or ten quarters, the clover hay,
which grew luxuriantly, two or three tons an acre, and the roots
were splendid.” He continues, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>“That Mr. William Standring
did not exaggerate the capacities of the isle, I can testify, as the
crops I saw there were wonderfully fine throughout, particularly
the potatoes, which are perhaps its mainstay.”<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a></p>

<p>The secret of the agricultural success of Axholme is clearly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la carrière ouverte aux talens</i>, which is secured to agricultural
labourers by the open fields. The spirited and successful
cultivation of varying crops follows naturally.</p>

<p>How the upward ladder is used, was well explained by a Mr.
John Standring, himself a holder of ten acres, before the Select
Committee of the House of Commons on Small Holdings
in 1889.</p>

<p>It is first to be noticed, however, that the general level of
wage is exceptionally high for a purely agricultural district at a
considerable distance from any considerable town. The customary
wage, I was informed in 1903, was <abbr title="3 shillings">3<i>s.</i></abbr> per day. Mr.
Rider Haggard, in 1901, found it “<abbr title="2 shillings and 9 pence">2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></abbr> a day for day men,
<abbr title="18 shillings">18<i>s.</i></abbr> a week for horsemen, and <abbr title="16 shillings">16<i>s.</i></abbr> a week, with cottage, for
garth-men. Men living in the house with foremen and owners
receive about <abbr title="24 pounds">£24</abbr> per annum and food, and horsemen <abbr title="30 pounds">£30</abbr> per
annum and food.”</p>

<p>But when the labourer who has been living in marries and
takes a cottage, he also takes up a holding in the fields. He
begins with one “land,” then takes a second, a third, and so on.
The following table, showing the way in which land is held in
the parish of Epworth, was submitted to the Select Committee<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a>
by Mr. J. Standring:&mdash;</p>

<p>The eighty holders occupying from half an acre to two acres
would all be men in regular employment, as a rule, agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
labourers. A body of these sent their deposition to the Select
Committee in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We, the undersigned, being agricultural labourers at
Epworth, are in occupation of allotments or small holdings,
varying from 2 roods to 3 acres, willingly testify to the great
benefit we find from our holdings. Where we have sufficient
quantity of land to grow 2 roods each of wheat, barley and
potatoes, we have bread, bacon, and potatoes for a great part of
the year, enabling us to face a long winter without the dread of
hunger or pauperism staring us in the face.”</p>

<p>But the more enterprising of these labourers do not rest
content with so small a holding, and these pass into the next
class, those who hold up to 10 acres. “Many such,” says
Mr. J. Standring, “keep a horse and a cow and a few pigs.
And on some of the stronger land two or three of these will
yoke their horses together and work their own land, and also
land belonging to other men similarly situated who do not keep
horses. As a rule they have done very well&mdash;I scarcely know a
failure.” The payment for horse-hire is usually made in labour.</p>

<p>The most successful of these again recruit the ranks of the
larger farmers. “I do not believe there is one in ten in my
parish, and in the adjoining parish, among those who are renting
from 50 to 100 acres, but what, in my time, has been an
agricultural labourer or an agricultural servant before he was
married; and each of them, to my own knowledge, has commenced
with two or three acres, and in some cases not more than
one acre ... one man who is now occupying 200 acres was a
labourer in his early days.”</p>

<p>These bigger farmers sometimes move elsewhere, and take
larger farms, or bring up their sons in other occupations than
farming, so that the farm of 150 to 200 acres becomes again
available for division into small holdings. Thus, in spite of
the continual growth of the holding occupied by individual men
at different stages in their career, the average size of holdings
does not show any tendency to increase. This is well shown by
the figures given for Epworth, respectively, by Arthur Young
and Mr. J. Standring, at about an interval of a hundred years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
There were only 236 claimants of allotments in the Epworth
commons at the end of the eighteenth century; in 1889 there
were 291 occupiers of the 5741 acres in the parish, occupying
therefore, on an average, less than 20 acres each.</p>

<p>The same eagerness to own land which Arthur Young noticed
has also continued to prevail. Land is bought on the building
society principle, money for the purpose being borrowed usually
at 5 per cent. per annum, very frequently through the lawyer who
conducts the sale. In the days of agricultural prosperity land
in the open fields of Haxey, Epworth, and Belton was sold at
<abbr title="130 pounds">£130</abbr> per acre; land in the one remaining open field of Owston
as high as <abbr title="140 pounds">£140</abbr> per acre. Even now, in spite of the tremendous
fall in price of agricultural produce, the ordinary price is about
<abbr title="70 pounds">£70</abbr> to <abbr title="75 pounds">£75</abbr> per acre; which is about twenty-five years’ purchase
of the rent.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a man who borrows money at 5 per cent. to
buy land which can only be let at 4 per cent. on the purchase
price embarks on a speculation which from the purely commercial
point of view, can only be profitable provided the land is
appreciating in value. There were naturally cases of men who,
at the time when prices were falling most rapidly, were unable
to keep up their payments of interest and instalments of principal,
and who had in consequence, after a severe struggle, to
forfeit their partially won property. At this time the Isle of
Axholme won the evil repute of being “the paradise of lawyers.”
But it would, I believe, be fair to say that the peasantry on the
whole stood the strain of agricultural depression exceptionally
well, and that their prosperity, with steadier prices, revived
exceptionally quickly.</p>

<p>The Isle of Axholme has been singularly successful in preserving
the spirit of the common field system&mdash;social equality,
mutual helpfulness, and an industrial aim directed rather towards
the maximum gross produce of food than towards the maximum
net profit; while at the same time it has discarded those features
of the system which would have been obstacles to agricultural
progress. The “barbarous omission” to enclose the open arable
fields has been abundantly justified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Soham.</h3>

<p>The parish of Soham, in Cambridgeshire, is another example
of a great development of small holdings in connection with the
persistence of open arable fields. This parish, unlike most
Cambridgeshire parishes, has never been enclosed by Act of
Parliament, and the tithe map indicates the survival of about
1100 acres of common field and 456 acres of common in a total
of 12,706 acres. Since the tithe commutation the area of common
has shrunk to about 236 acres, but from the Ordnance map it
appears that there is still a very large area of open field land in
four large fields, known as North Field, Clipsatt Field, No Ditch
Field, and Down Field; and a smaller one, Bancroft Field. Mr.
Charles Bidwell gave the Special Committee on Small Holdings
(1889) the following account of holdings in this parish:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus the total area of the parish is held by 457 occupiers, who
therefore hold, on an average, 28 acres each. In this case it is
stated that the occupiers of the smallest holdings derive considerable
benefit from the common. A German enquirer who
visited Soham as an example of an unenclosed parish, found it
less poverty stricken than the other parishes in the neighbourhood,
on account, he was told, of the existence of the common
pastures. (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">W. Hasbach, Die englischen Landarbeiter, 1894</cite>.)</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Weston Zoyland.</h3>

<p>The idea occurs to one, whether it would not have been
possible to secure by an Act of Enclosure for a common field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the abolition of common rights which hindered each farmer
or peasant from cultivating his holding to the best of his
ability, and the laying together of the scattered strips which
formed each holding, without ruining the small proprietors and
small farmers, or encouraging the laying down of tilled land
under pasture.</p>

<p>We find <em>one</em> example of such an attempt. The parish of
Weston Zoyland, in Somerset, in 1797 enclosed 644 acres of
commonable pasture, and at that time and in that neighbourhood
the enclosure of Sedgemoor was being rapidly pushed on, as
rapidly, in fact, as the local farmers could be induced to take up
the land. Perhaps in consequence of this quenching of the land
hunger of the farmers with capital, when in 1830 it was resolved
to deal with the common fields, the Act took the form of one for
<em>dividing and allotting</em>, but not enclosing, Weston Field. The
consequence is that this great field of 500 acres still remains open
and unenclosed; the land is specially fertile, there are an exceptionally
large number of small properties in it, and it is all kept
under tillage. I am informed that one of the first acts of the
Weston Zoyland Parish Council, when, on coming into existence,
it took over the custody of the parish maps and documents, was
to re-define the roads that passed through the field, in accordance
with the Commissioners’ map and award.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Upton <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonards (near Gloucester).</h3>

<p>This enclosure took place at the same time as that of Castor
and Ailesworth, and was completed in 1899. The common
fields consisted of 1120 strips of arable land, total area 520 acres,
and the “balks” or “meres” separating the strips were estimated
at 14 acres. There were more than eighty owners.</p>

<p>No recognised course of husbandry had been followed for
about sixty years previously. It is believed that before that
time a four-year course obtained, but when mangel wurzels were
introduced to the neighbourhood the recurring fallow was discontinued.
The right of common after harvest was, however,
still maintained. If any cultivator chose he might grow
turnips, but he did so at his own risk, and had to keep a boy
to guard them from the opening of the fields to the time they
could be pulled. Old mere stones are found in the meadows of
this parish, and various local traditions remain belonging,
apparently, to a period when the village customs resembled
those described for Stratton and Grimstone.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Totternhoe (Bedfordshire).</h3>

<p>The Enclosure Act was passed in 1886, and the award is dated
1891. Before enclosure Totternhoe was a typical open-field
parish; there were only 370 acres of old enclosure, to 1797 acres
of common field arable, and 193 acres of common. The situation
of Totternhoe is like that of Clothall, on the steep northern slope
of the Hertfordshire chalk hills, which here have an almost
mountainous appearance. The greater part of the parish was
in the ownership of the lord of the manor, but there were forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
owners of land altogether, the others being chiefly yeomen. The
movement for enclosure came from these yeomen. They took this
step in order to protect themselves against the tenants of the
lord of the manor, who, whether from ignorance or otherwise,
endeavoured to prevent the exercise of well-known rights of
common over land in their occupation. The hill top was saved
as an open space, and is a favourite picnic resort for the people
of Dunstable. Recreation grounds and land for allotments were
also set out, as has been the rule since the passing of the
Commons Act of 1876. I asked one of the yeomen, who had
taken a leading part in bringing about the enclosure, whether it
had benefited the parish. He said undoubtedly it had done so,
but “the parish has not recovered from it yet.” Questioned as
to how this could be, he gave me to understand that the actual
increase to the cultivators in annual value was not equal to the
interest on the capital expended on carrying out the enclosure;
that the assessment had gone up, and the burden of rates and
taxes was consequently increased. The land allotted to the
lord of the manor still, in the summer of 1900, was mainly unenclosed,
and one could get something of the impression of
the “champion” country, an impression of great open fields
sweeping up to bare downs.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">North and South Luffenham and Barrowden (Rutland).</h3>

<p>The first steps towards the enclosure of these three parishes
were made immediately after the passing of the 1876 Act; the
Enclosure Act was passed in 1878, and the awards were made
in 1881 and 1882. Out of 5480 acres in the three parishes,
4800 were common-field arable, a heath claimed by both Barrowden
and South Luffenham occupied 390 acres, and much of the
remainder was commonable meadow and pasture. Two systems
of cultivation obtained. Part of the land being heavy clay was
on a three years’ course of wheat, beans, etc., and fallow, as at
Laxton and Eakring; the lighter land was under a six years’
course. The report of the Enclosure Commissioners says of
Barrowden that the 1240 acres of arable land <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>“is divided in
2790 strips, some not more than 12 feet wide, each divided from
its neighbour by a green balk, which is a nursery of weeds.”
Old farmers, however, assured me that the balks were mostly
gone before enclosure. Field reeves were elected, and they
settled any dispute that arose in consequence of the absence of
balks, and individual farmers quickly detected, by pacing across
their strips, if a furrow had been appropriated by a neighbour.</p>

<p>Here, again, I asked whether the enclosure had been a benefit,
and I was told that the labourers had benefited by the allotments
and recreation grounds; that the lord of the manor of
South Luffenham had benefited, because he got the disputed
moor, but that farmers, as farmers, had gained nothing, and as
common-right owners they had lost through the enclosure of
the moor.</p>

<p>Enclosure in this case originated in what may be called the
normal way, <i>i.e.</i>, on the initiative of the lords of the manors. It
was the doubtful ownership of the Barrowden and Luffenham
moor which had until 1876 prevented enclosure; then the
respective lords agreed to combine to obtain an enclosure of all
three parishes, and let the Commissioners determine to which
parish the moor belonged. It was awarded to Luffenham, but
the Luffenham freeholders lost it just as much as those of
Barrowden; it is now the private property of the lord of the
manor.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Ham Field.</h3>

<p>A curious case of enclosure by Act of Parliament unconnected
with the General Enclosure Acts is that of Ham Field
by the “Richmond, Petersham and Ham Open Spaces Act,
1902” (<cite>2 Edward <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> <abbr title="253">ccliii.</abbr></cite>). It is entitled, “An Act
to confirm agreements for vesting common and other land
in the local authorities of the districts of Richmond and Ham,
and the Surrey County Council as public open spaces, and for
other purposes.” But while it does incidentally confirm these
agreements, the “other purposes” comprise the main object of
the bill, which is to allow the owners of Ham Common, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the Earl of Dysart is the principal, to enclose Ham Common
Field, and convert it into building land.</p>

<p>The preamble is similarly misleading. The first sentence
runs, “Whereas the prospect from Richmond Hill over the
valley of the Thames is of great natural beauty, and agreements
have been entered into with a view to preventing building on
certain lands hereinafter mentioned”&mdash;a sentence admirably
framed to disguise the fact that the effect of the Act is to
extinguish the common rights over Ham Field which had
previously prevented building, and so to convert the middle
distance of the famous view from Richmond Hill into an
expanse of roofs, perhaps of villa-residences, and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>The agreements recited in the Act represent the consideration
for which the public authorities mentioned bartered away
the beauty of the view. Kingston Corporation gets nine acres
for a cricket field; Richmond Corporation is confirmed in the
ownership of Petersham Meadows, which was formerly a subject
of dispute, and acquires a strip of land along the river; and the
Surrey County Council acquires 45 acres of riverside land.
The meadows and riverside land in each case are to be
maintained as open spaces by the authorities. Ham itself
merely gets the freehold of Ham Common, which means, in
effect, that what slight danger there might have been of the
enclosure of this part of the open and commonable land of the
parish is removed.</p>

<p>The Earl of Dysart, at the cost of a sacrifice that is probably
apparent rather than real, obtains by this Act the right to
convert some 200 acres of arable common field into a valuable
building estate; the smaller owners acquire a similar right
without any compensating sacrifice at all; and the only losers by
this profitable transaction are the people of London, who were
not consulted in the matter.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Merrow.</h3>

<p>The parish of Merrow, adjoining Guildford on the east, is
stated in the return of 1873 to have had 350 acres of common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
field. The land in question covers the lower slopes of the chalk
hill, the higher portion of which is Merrow Down; beneath it is
Clandon Park, the seat of Lord Onslow. Up to about the year
1873 this common field did exist; the properties of Lord
Onslow, the chief proprietor, were very much intermixed with
those of smaller proprietors; the farm holdings were similarly
intermixed with one another, and with a number of strips of
land occupied by labourers and cultivated as allotments. But
no common rights were exercised over these lands, either by the
occupiers over one another’s lands, or by the villagers, within
living memory; nor, except that the whole of the field was in
tillage, was there any common rule for its cultivation. The
existence of a great extent of common is in itself a sufficient
explanation of the disappearance of common rights over the
tilled land.</p>

<p>In 1870 the present Lord Onslow came into the property, and
when a year or two later he attained his majority, he proceeded
to consolidate his property in Merrow Field, by buying out the
other proprietors, or giving them land elsewhere in exchange.
The field is still bare of hedges, and under tillage; but
enclosure, in the technical sense, has been completely carried
without an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Since the enclosure the allotments, which had been numerous,
have generally been given up; but the labourers do not attribute
this to the enclosure, but to the industrial evolution. “There
are no farmers nowadays, only land spoilers. They’ve turned
market gardeners, and they sell <em>milk</em>” (with intense scorn).
“The land ought to grow beef, and barley to make good beer, that’s
what Englishmen want,&mdash;yes, and wheat to make bread. But
now they all grow garden stuff, what’s the good of an allotment
to a man? If you have anything to sell, you can’t sell it. It’s
no good growing any more than you can eat.”</p>

<p>It may be added that along the river Wey, from Guildford
down to Byfleet, there are some very extensive lammas meadows,
known by such names as Broad Mead and Hook Mead. The
holdings in these are intermixed, individual pieces sometimes
not exceeding an acre.</p>

<p>As Brightwell was enclosed in 1811, and East Hendred in
1801, the statement with regard to these two parishes plainly is
incredible; but in view of the undeniable fact that Steventon,
which lies almost in the centre of this district, was not enclosed
till 1883, there seemed so much possibility of survivals in the
other parishes that in July, 1904, I traversed the whole district
in search of such survivals. But the search was entirely
unsuccessful; it was plain that Steventon was at the time of its
enclosure the last remaining example of the old system in this
part.</p>

<p>Here, as in the Hertfordshire district described <a href="#herts" title="Go to the description of the Hertfordshire district.">above</a>, and in
the Wiltshire district dealt with in <a href="#chapter_10" title="Go to Chapter 10.">Chapter X., “Enclosure and
Depopulation,”</a> enclosure is one aspect of a change of which the
most vital aspects are the engrossing of farms and the consolidation
of properties. In each parish this movement proceeds
along the line of least resistance; in one parish all impediments
in the way of the most profitable management of estates are
swept away by the drastic remedy of an Enclosure Act; in others
they are removed gradually.</p>

<p>The latter method I was enabled, by the help of Mr. Bridges,
to trace in detail in the case of Yattenden. The Board of
Agriculture return, as we have seen, assigns 252 acres of
common field to Yattenden. The tithe map, dated 1845, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
which this is based, shows in one corner of “Yattenden Great
Field” about 20 acres of intermixed ownership and occupation,
forming part of one “furlong,” remaining in the characteristic
common-field arrangement; the rest of the so-called “Yattenden
Great Field” and “Everington Field” were in part divided into
hedged fields, and in part into compact stretches of about 20
acres each, still unhedged, with here and there single acres
detached in the midst of them; many of these single acres
being glebe.</p>

<p>An older manorial map, dated 1773, showed that at that date
nearly half the parish was open; the eastern part was already
divided into closes, except for a small stretch of lammas meadow,
divided into small intermixed holdings, by the river Pang; but
the western part, Yattenden and Everington fields, were almost
entirely open, and divided in furlongs, and the furlongs in acre
and half-acre strips. These strips on the map are all marked
with the letters of the alphabet, to indicate whether they are
held by the lord of the manor, by his tenants, or by other
owners.</p>

<p>In other words, the process of gradual enclosure, which began
before 1773, was continued afterwards, and was nearly complete
in 1845. The end came about the year 1858, when Frilsham
Common, in an adjoining parish, was enclosed. About half of
the intermixed strips in Yattenden Great Field belonged to a
yeoman, who was, his brother told me, “a great man for
defining his boundaries.” The enclosure of Frilsham Common
gave the slight stimulus to the mind of Yattenden necessary to
overcome its mental inertia, and make change possible, so the
yeoman in question was able to effect the exchanges he desired,
and others following his example, the lay properties were all
separated. But still the glebe consists in part of an acre here
and an acre there in the midst of lands belonging to laymen.
These are let with the lands in which they lie; they have no
mark to distinguish them, nor boundaries to limit them; the
tithe map and award preserve the record of them, and the vicar
receives their rent.</p>

<p>This circumstance of the glebe lying in part in separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
unfenced strips scattered over the parish, let with the lands in
which they lie, and so not influencing the agriculture of the
parish, though testifying to the past system, is by no means
uncommon in the parishes not enclosed by Act of Parliament.<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#Anchor_15" title="Return to text.">[15]</a> Mr. A. N. Palmer, in “<cite>Ancient Tenures of Land in the Marches of North
Wales</cite>,” gives a list of parishes in one Hundred containing, or known to have
contained, “quilleted fields,” <i>i.e.</i> fields containing strips of land belonging to a
different owner from the rest of the field, these strips being usually glebe.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>In general the results of the two different methods of enclosure
in this district are practically identical. Superficially the
characteristic features of the “champaign” or “champion”
country remain. The population is concentrated in the villages;
the sites of which appear to have been originally selected for convenience
of water supply; outside the villages are the long sweeps
of open fields of barley, wheat or beans, lying generally open to the
roads, and to one another, and to the open down, though one notices
a tendency to an increased use of wire fencing. The monotony is
broken by the beautiful curves of the hill slopes, and by clumps
of trees; here and there, on steeper inclines, lynches are clearly
visible, and occasionally what looks like an inconsequent hedge,
beginning and ending in the middle of the field&mdash;an old “mere”
or “balk” on which bushes happened to grow.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the farms run generally from 200 to over
1000 acres each; machinery is extensively used; the supply of
labour, though not so superabundant as a generation or two ago,
is still sufficient, the customary wage being <abbr title="2 shillings">2<i>s.</i></abbr> per day. The
men themselves struck me as being of finer physique than the
agricultural labourers I have seen in any other part of the South
or Midlands of England; but they appear to be as completely
shut out from any rights over the land, from any enterprise of
their own upon the land, or from any opportunities for rising
into the farmers’ class as can well be conceived. Only one man
whom I met could remember a different condition. He, a
labourer of seventy-three, said that in North Moreton before
the enclosure (completed in 1849) every villager who could get
a cow could keep it in the open fields, and all the villagers also
had rights of cutting fuel. Under the Enclosure Act some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
moneys were set aside to provide the poor with fuel in compensation
for these rights, but latterly the amount provided had
much diminished.</p>

<p>Steventon, which lies in the centre of this district, is to some
extent exceptional. The manor has always been in ecclesiastical
hands, from the first time when the village was founded as a
settlement from the Abbey of Bec in Normandy to the present
day, when it is held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. In
the intervening period it belonged to Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>No doubt it was in consequence of this that through the
greater part of the nineteenth century, while all the other
parishes passed into their present condition of large farms, the
farms and properties in Steventon remained small. Up to about
1874 there were some eighteen yeomen farmers in the parish,
which comprises 2,382 acres, fully three-quarters at that time
being arable. In addition, the lands belonging to the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners were divided into small holdings, and
all these were intermixed. The system of cultivation was very
simple. The arable land was divided into two fields, one known
as the “white corn field,” growing wheat or barley, the other
as the “black corn field,” growing pulse or some other crop.</p>

<p>In the severe agricultural depression that followed 1874,
culminating in 1879, the yeomen were obliged to borrow in
order to continue farming, and they mortgaged their lands to
certain gentlemen in the neighbourhood who had money to
invest. As one bad season followed another, loan had to be
added to loan, till the security was exhausted, and the land
passed into the possession of the mortgagee. In this way the
number of landowners was reduced to five. Then enclosure,
which had been proposed and rejected in the forties, was
resolved upon. The Act was obtained in 1880, and the award
was made in 1883.</p>

<p>There was considerable disappointment among those who
carried out the enclosure at the results. They were surprised
and disgusted at the amount of land reserved for allotments and
recreation ground; they were also surprised at the expense,
which amounted, I was told, to nearly <abbr title="10,000 pounds">£10,000</abbr>. Some were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
unable to meet the calls upon them, and went bankrupt. But
a large portion of the cost was for road-making, and when this
had been paid for, the chief advantage which had been gained
by the whole proceeding, economy in horse labour, was realised.
Where previously it had taken three horses to get a load of
manure to a given spot in the open fields, along the tracks
assigned for that purpose, one horse could draw the same load
to the nearest point on the metalled roadway, and a second
horse hitched in front would enable it to reach its destination.</p>

<p>A glance at the accompanying <a href="#enclosure" title="Go to the Enclosure Map of England.">Enclosure Map of England</a>
will indicate the importance of common fields in the social life
of rural England at certain dates. It was prepared in the
following manner: On the Ordnance County diagrams each
parish which had an Enclosure Act by which common field
arable was enclosed was coloured; if the Act was passed
between 1700 and 1801 it was coloured yellow; if passed after
the general Enclosure Act of 1801 and before that of 1845, it
was coloured green; if after 1845, purple. A map of England
was drawn summarising the results of the county maps. On
this <em>at least</em> all purple patches showed parishes which possessed
open field arable in 1845; <em>at least</em> all the green and purple area
combined indicated parishes which had open field arable in
1802; <em>at least</em> all the coloured area had open field arable in
1700. In the printed map these colours are represented by
three forms of shading. Of the unshaded area one can simply
say that the Enclosure Acts throw no light upon its agricultural
history so far as the land under tillage is concerned. To
a very great extent it was undoubtedly being enclosed otherwise
than by Act of Parliament simultaneously with the progress of
Parliamentary enclosure, but to a still greater extent it either
never passed through the common field system or was enclosed
before 1700. This statement raises questions which are dealt
with below. For the present I have to deal with the general
history of those parishes which did pass through the common
field system.</p>

<p>The original Board of Agriculture, which was an association
on similar lines to those of the Royal Agricultural Society, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
enjoying a grant from the Treasury, was founded in 1793, with
Arthur Young as secretary and Sir John Sinclair as president.
It immediately took in hand the work of making an agricultural
survey of Great Britain, county by county. Some counties were
surveyed several times, but the original survey of England was
completed in the years 1793 and 1794. William Marshall, the
ablest agricultural writer of the time, single-handed accomplished
an agricultural survey of England, ignoring county
divisions and dividing the country according to natural divisions
marked by similarity of soil, crops and agricultural methods.
The two surveys together give us ample information on the
different methods of cultivating open or common fields at the
end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>On the whole, the most general system, particularly in the
midland counties where common fields remained most numerous,
was the following form of the three-field system:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One part” (or one of the three fields) “is annually fallowed,
a moiety of which is folded with sheep and sown with wheat;
another moiety is dunged and sown with barley in the succeeding
spring. The part which produces wheat is broken up and
sown with oats, and the part which produces barley is at the
same time generally sown with peas or beans, and then it comes
in routine to be again fallowed the third year.”<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> This gives us
the following rotation of crops: (1), wheat; (2), oats; (3), fallow;
(4), barley; (5), peas or beans; (6), fallow. This was the
system prevailing in Huntingdon.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The same system prevailed in the heavy clay lands of Bedfordshire,
but in the lighter lands sometimes a four-field course
was adopted, sometimes the half of the nominally fallow field
that had the previous year given crops of wheat and oats
was sown with turnips, and clover was sown with barley the
succeeding year.<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a></p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The commonest four-field course is that described for Isleham,
Cambridgeshire: (1), wheat; (2), barley; (3), pulse or oats;
(4), fallow; the fallow field being dunged or folded with sheep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
At Castle Camps, also in Cambridge, a two-field course of
alternate crop and fallow obtained.<a name="Anchor_18" id="Anchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a></p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Coming further south for Hertfordshire, we are told that the
“common fields are mostly by agreement among the owners and
occupiers cultivated nearly in the same way as in the enclosed
state.”<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> In Buckinghamshire the regular three-fields course
was followed in some parts, but in Upton, Eton, Dorney,
Datchett, Maysbury and Horton, “the occupiers have exploded
entirely the old usage of two crops and a fallow, and now have a
crop every year.”</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Two Buckinghamshire parishes underwent experiences which
have been wrongly cited as typical of the inconveniences of
common fields, whereas they are rather instances of the lawless
conduct of village bullies. Steeple Claydon had 2500 acres of
common field, on which the customary course was one crop and
a fallow. “About fourteen years ago” (<i>i.e.</i>, about 1779) “the
proprietors came to an agreement to have two crops and a
fallow, but before the expiration of ten years one of the farmers
broke through the agreement, and turned in his cattle upon the
crops of beans, oats and barley, in which plan he was soon
followed by the rest.”<a name="Anchor_20" id="Anchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> The agreement, if that of a three-fourths
majority (see <a href="#chapter_9" title="Go to Chapter 9.">below</a>), was legally binding on all owners and
occupiers, and the first farmer was liable to the same
pains and penalties as if he had turned his cattle into
crops standing on enclosed fields belonging to another farm.
Possibly, however, the crops were a failure, and feeding them
off with cattle was as good a way of dealing with them as
another.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>A still more difficult case to understand is that of Wendon
(3000 acres common field). It is reported as follows:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>“About
fourteen years ago the parishioners came to an agreement and
obtained an Act to lay the small pieces of land together....
When the division took place, the balks were of necessity
ploughed up, by which a great portion of the sheep pasture was
destroyed.<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> It then became expedient, and it was agreed upon
at public vestry, to sow clover and turnips as a succedaneum for
the balks. Two years since, one of the farmers, occupying
16 acres of these common fields, procured in the month of May
a large flock of lean sheep, which he turned on the clover crops;
being then nearly in bloom, the greater part of which they
devoured.”</p>

<p>Of Oxfordshire we are told “the present course of husbandry
is so various, particularly in the open fields, that to treat of all
the different ways of management would render this report too
voluminous. It may suffice generally to remark that some fields
are in the course of one crop and fallow, others of two, and a
few of three crops and a fallow. In divers unenclosed parishes
the same rotation prevails over the whole of the open fields;
but in others, the more homeward or bettermost land is oftener
cropped, or sometimes cropped every year.”<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> Where one crop
and a fallow was the custom the crop might be wheat, barley
or oats; and sometimes tares were sown on the fallow field and
cut green. The three and four-field systems prevalent were
those described above.</p>

<p>In Berkshire a six-year course, evidently evolved from an
older three-years course, was found:&mdash;(1), wheat; (2), barley;
(3), oats, with seeds; (4), clover, mowed, and then grazed upon
in common; (5), oats or barley; (6), fallow.</p>

<p>An agreement to withhold turning out stock during the time
in which a field was commonable by ancient custom, in order
that turnips, vetches, etc., might be grown, was practised, and
termed “hitching the fields.”<a name="Anchor_23" id="Anchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> We get the same expression for
Wiltshire, where a part of a field set aside for vetches, peas,
beans, turnips, or potatoes was called a “hookland” or “hitchland”
field.<a name="Anchor_24" id="Anchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> In Wiltshire customs similar to these described
as surviving recently in Stratton and Grimstone were prevalent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
clover was generally substituted for fallow, and was partly mowed
for the individual benefit of particular occupiers, and partly fed
upon by the village flock. The following systems are reported:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) First, wheat; second, barley with clover; third, clover
part mowed, part fed.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) First, wheat; second, barley; third, oats with clover;
fourth, clover part mowed, part fed.</p>

being “hitchland”).<a name="Anchor_25" id="Anchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a></p>

<span class="sub_head">NORFOLK AGRICULTURE.</span></h2>

<p>When we come to Norfolk we find hints at so many special
features that Norfolk agriculture demands separate treatment.
The preamble of a Norfolk Enclosure Act is remarkably different
from those for the rest of the country. A typical one is <cite>1795,
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 67</cite>:</p>

<p id="sedgeford">“Whereas there are in the parish of Sedgeford in the county
of Norfolk divers lands and grounds, called whole-year lands,
brecks, common fields, half-year or shack lands, commons and
waste grounds.... And whereas there are certain rights
of sheep-walk, shackage and common, over the said brecks, half-year
or shack land, commons and waste grounds. And great part
of the said whole-year lands, as well as the brecks, common fields,
and half-year or shack lands, are inconveniently situated,” etc.</p>

<p>Or again <cite>1804, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 24</cite>:</p>

<p>“Whereas there are in the parish of Waborne in the county
of Norfolk divers lands and grounds called whole-year lands,
common fields, doles, half-year or shack lands, commons and
waste grounds.”</p>

<p>“Whereas the said common fields, doles, half-year lands,
shack lands, commons and waste grounds, are subject to certain
rights of sheep-walk, shackage and common, and great part of
the said whole-year lands, common fields, and half-year or shack
lands are inconveniently situated for the various owners and
proprietors thereof....”</p>

<p>Other Norfolk acts mention doles, ings, carrs, and buscallys.
Buscallys we may take to mean woods in which rights
of common for fuel were practised. <cite>Dr. Murray’s Dictionary</cite>
gives us bushaile or buscayle, from Old French <i lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">boschaille</i>,
Low Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boscalia</i>, shrubberies, thickets, etc. “Dole,” is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
connected etymologically both with “deal” and with the word
“run-dale,” concerning which see <a href="#chapter_15" title="Go to Chapter 15.">below</a>. The word is frequently
found elsewhere, as in the “dolemeads” at Bristol and Bath,
and usually means meadows, the ownership of which is intermixed
in small parcels, which are commonable after hay harvest,
but sometimes the word is used of arable land (see <a href="#carrock" title="Go to description of Castle Carrock.">below</a>). The
Act for Earsham, Ditchingham and Hedenham (<cite>Norfolk, 1812,
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 17</cite>) has the sentence, “The said dole meadow lands lie intermixed
and dispersed.” The “ings” and “carrs” are best
understood by the help of the old Ordnance Survey map for
Norfolk. The carrs are the lowest, swampiest part of the
common pastures which reach down to the rivers; the ings,
while also low-lying, are separated from the rivers by the carrs,
and intervene between the carrs and the tilled lands.</p>

<p>There remain the expressions whole-year lands, half-year or
shack lands, and brecks, to interpret.</p>

<p>Half-year lands obviously means lands commonable for half
the year, <i>i.e.</i>, after the crop has been carried. They are also
“shack” lands, or lands on which right of “shackage” exists.
“Shack” is connected with “shake,” and right of shackage
appears to be the right to carry off the gleanings after the crop
has been carried and the fields are thrown open. It is, however,
to be noticed that half-year or shack lands are mentioned as
something distinct from common fields. The distinction is said
to be that common rights on shack lands can be exercised only
by the owners or occupiers of those lands. Shack lands may
be termed common fields, but the term common field may be
reserved for those fields over which cottagers or toft holders or
others also possess rights of common.</p>

<p>“Brecks” are asserted by William Marshall (<cite>“Rural Economy
of Norfolk,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 376</cite>) to be “large new-made enclosures,”
but as is seen from the wording of the Acts quoted, they are
enclosures still “subject to certain rights of shackage, sheep-walk,
and common.”<a name="Anchor_31" id="Anchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> Lastly, what are “whole-year lands”?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31" href="#Anchor_31" title="Return to text.">[31]</a> <cite>1820, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 29 (Blakeney, Wiverton and Glanford)</cite> mentions “whole-year lands,
whole-year brecks, whole-year marshes.” In this case, apparently, brecks are
not commonable.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>Since half-year lands are lands which for half the year are
common, and for half the year are in individual ownership
and use, one would argue that whole-year lands must
be lands which are in individual ownership and use the
whole year; for if they were common the whole year they
would be termed simply “commons.” We get further
light by comparing the preambles of other Norfolk Acts.
Some instead of whole-year lands mention every-year lands,
others speak of “whole-year or every-year lands,” while finally
Icklingham in Suffolk (<cite>1813, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 29</cite>) gives us “every year lands
or Infields.”</p>

<p>Now “infields” is a familiar expression in Scottish agriculture.
Even in the Lothians, up to the middle of the eighteenth century
the cultivated land was divided into infield and outfield. The
outfield, like the outfield on the Yorkshire Wolds, only bore
occasional crops, and was never manured, all the manure being
reserved for the infield, which was made to bear a crop every
year. In Haddington the customary course was: (1) pease;
(2) wheat; (3) barley; (4) oats; and then the land was dunged
and planted with pease again; and leases stipulated for “the
preservation and regular dunging of the mucked land shotts.”<a name="Anchor_32" id="Anchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a>
Such lands might obviously be described as every-year lands, and
since this method of cultivation implies that immediately one
crop is carried preparation must be made for the next, and therefore
is not easily consistent with common rights, so these lands
are also “whole-year lands.” It may be noted that the Norfolk
preambles (as in the Sedgeford example, <a href="#sedgeford" title="Go to the Sedgeford example.">quoted above</a>), while
stating that the “whole-year lands,” as well as the brecks,
common fields and half-year lands are inconveniently situated,
<i>i.e.</i>, are intermixed, by implication give us to understand that
they are not subject to rights of shackage, sheep-walk, and
common.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32" href="#Anchor_32" title="Return to text.">[32]</a> <cite>George Buchan Hepburn, “Agriculture of East Lothian,” 1794, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>It is the more curious to find that Norfolk and the adjoining
part of Suffolk followed a traditional method of cultivation in
this respect similar to that of the East of Scotland, because there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
are so few traces of anything similar in the intervening counties.
I find infields mentioned twice in Northumberland, once in
Lincoln, whole-year lands once in Huntingdon. There is also
mention of half-year lands in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire.
The Wessex custom of “hitching the fields,” or “cropping the
homeward or bettermost part of the common fields every year”
is not the same thing, because there, as we saw in the case of
Stratton and Grimstone, the extra crop was raised for common,
not for individual, benefit. Battersea common fields were
worked as every-year lands, and so are the Axholme fields
to-day; but in these cases the custom was locally derived
from some other form of cultivation; whereas in Norfolk and
Suffolk the peculiar customs must have been indigenous and
ancient.</p>

<p>One is also tempted to ask whether it is a coincidence that
Norfolk farmers in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and
Lothian farmers in the nineteenth, enjoyed and deserved an
extremely high reputation for scientific, enterprising, and skilful
agriculture. The ancient custom of raising crops every year
from the same land must have necessitated the gradual accumulation
of knowledge on the best ways of preventing exhaustion
of the soil, by marling, manuring, deep ploughing, and various
rotations of crops. When turnip culture was introduced into
England, it was to Norfolk that the new idea was brought.
There was no obstacle to growing turnips on the Norfolk whole-year
lands, such as would have arisen if toft holders had the
right to turn horses, cattle and sheep on to the lands at Lammas;
and the intervention of a new crop which gave an opportunity
for getting the land clean of weeds, and increased its fertility
for grain crops, was a far more obvious boon there than on lands
subject to a periodic fallow.</p>

<p>But to return to the typical Norfolk Enclosure Act preamble.
We have only half explained the problem suggested by the four
different names, each evidently with a distinct meaning, but all
meaning arable land in which ownership is intermixed as in an
ordinary common field, viz., whole-year lands, half-year lands or
shack lands, brecks and common fields. The rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
explanation is, I think, to be looked for in the direction suggested
by the prominence given to the statement, “They are subject to
rights of sheep-walk.” Elsewhere one finds a close connection
between sheep and common fields. Thus we have seen that at
Eakring certain common right owners make a speciality of
pasturing sheep on the common fields. The Swedish traveller
Kaln, whose account of his visit to England has recently been
translated into English, observed the same thing on the open
field parishes of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire in the year 1748
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 302</cite>). But in 1793 where there were open chalky downs in
open field parishes the right of pasturing sheep on the downs
and of having the combined flock of the village folded over the
arable in the common field was valued too highly by every
occupier to be ceded to an individual speculator (<cite>Davies,
“Wiltshire,” <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 8, 15, 61, 80</cite>). In these cases right of
common for sheep has been democratically shared.</p>

<p>But this is not universal. The Enclosure Commissioners,
in their thirty-eighth report (1883), record the application for
an Enclosure Act for Hildersham, Cambridgeshire. In this
parish the two <em>manor farms</em> had the right of turning their
sheep every sixth year on to the stubbles of the other farms.
Similarly, I am told by Major Barnard, of Cheltenham, that
in the Cambridgeshire parish of Bartlow, where he was born,
which was enclosed with Shudy Camps and Castle Camps in
1863, that the right of feeding sheep on the common fields
belonged to the lord of the manor only. These Cambridgeshire
parishes are close to the borders of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the
following passage from <cite>Tusser’s “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Champion and Several</span>”</cite> (date
1573) suggests the same rule as applying to Norfolk and the
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champion</span>” (<i>i.e.</i>, open field) part of Suffolk:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>If it be urged that the two italicised lines are not necessarily
to be read together, in view of the other topics touched on in
the intermediate lines, the argument is not much affected, for
Tusser shows no knowledge of any “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champion</span>” counties other
than Leicestershire, Cambridgeshire, and Norfolk, and elsewhere
in the poem he deals with the special evils afflicting the two
former counties.</p>

<p>I may also refer to the <cite>Act, 25 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 13</cite>, to limit
the number of sheep which may be possessed by a single owner,
in which occurs the passage:&mdash;</p>

<p lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng"><abbr title="10">X.</abbr> Be it also further enacted by the authority aforesaid,
That no manner of Person or Persons, of what Degree soever
he or they be, being Lord or Lords, Owner or Owners, Farmer
or Farmers, of or in any Liberty of Fold Courses within any
Town, Tything, Village or Hamlet within any of the Counties
of Norfolk or Suffolk, from and after the Feast of the Nativity
of our Lord God next coming, shall take in farm, for term of
years or otherwise, any Quillets of Lands or Pastures, that is
to say, any number of Acres of Land or Pasture appertaining to
any other Person or Persons, lying and being within the limit
Extent or Precinct of the said Liberty of the said Fold Courses;
but that they shall permit and suffer the said Persons, having
or being, for the time, Owner or Owners, Lessee or Lessees of
the said Quillets, to manure and pasture the said Quillets; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
also to suffer sheep of the said Owner or Owners, Farmer or
Farmers of the said Quillets, after the Rate of the said Quillets,
to go with the Flock of the Owner, Farmer or Occupier of the
said Liberty or Liberties of the said Fold Courses, paying the
customary charge for the same, after the Rate and Use of the
Country, there commonly used, without any interruption therein
to be made by the said Owner or Owners, Farmer or Farmers,
or Occupiers of the said Liberties, upon pain of forfeiture for
<abbr title="3 shillings and 4 pence">3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></abbr> for each offence.</p>

<p lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">“<abbr title="11">XI.</abbr> Provided ... it shall not ... be available to any
tenant Owner or Occupier of any such Quillet or Quillets to
claim, have or use hereafter any such pasture, or Feeding of
his sheep, in or with any such Fold Courses, but only where
the tenants, Owners and Occupiers of any such Quillets have
had, or might have had heretofore of Right and Duty, or used
to have Pasture and Feeding in the said Fold Courses, by
reason of their tenures, and Occupations of the said Quillet
and Quillets, and none otherwise; and where they have not
used, nor ought to have any Sheep fed or kept within

Owners or Occupiers of such Fold Courses may take such
Quillets, lying within their Fold Courses, in Farm, agreeing
with the Owners or Occupiers of the said Quillets for the
same.”</p>

<p>It would appear from these clauses that there had been in
still earlier times generally throughout Norfolk and Suffolk a
right pertaining to the Lord of the Manor of feeding flocks of
sheep over the whole manor, that this right, in the reign of
Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> was frequently sold or leased under the denomination
“A Liberty of Fold Courses”; secondly that the exercise
of this right was apt to interfere with the cultivation of peasants’
holdings in the common fields; thirdly that it was customary
for the sheep belonging to the peasants to be pastured and
folded with the flock of the Lord of the Manor for a fixed
customary fee.</p>

<p>There is yet another respect in which Norfolk agriculture
shows a difference, but of degree, not kind, from other common-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>field
agriculture. Complete enclosure of common-field arable
involves three processes&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The laying together of scattered properties, and consequent
abolition of intermixture of properties and holdings;</p>

<p>(2) The abolition of common rights;</p>

<p>(3) The hedging and ditching of the separate properties.
This third process is the actual “enclosing” which gives its
name to a series of processes which it completes.</p>

<p>But sometimes the hedging and ditching takes place independently
of the other two processes, and strips of an acre,
two or more acres, and even half-an-acre are enclosed in the
middle of the common-fields, and, what is more remarkable,
the little enclosed strips are sometimes the property of several
individuals. In the collection of maps of open field parishes
belonging to certain Oxford Colleges, published by Mr. J. L. G.
Mowat, several such instances may be noticed.</p>

<p>Such enclosures were at first commonable; but common
rights were of course exercised over them with greater difficulty
than over the open parts of the enclosed fields, a fact on which
the above quoted opinion on the Barn farm at Elmstone Hardwicke
incidentally throws some light. The maintenance of
these common rights is a sort of test of the democratic vigour
of the village, and it may be noticed that old enclosures subject
to common rights were particularly numerous in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Norfolk was remarkable for the extent to which actual hedging
and ditching preceded legal enclosure. The Board of Agriculture
reporter says, “for notwithstanding common rights for
great cattle exist in all of them,<a name="Anchor_33" id="Anchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> and even sheep-walk privileges
in many, yet the natural industry of the people is such, that
wherever a person can get four or five acres together, he plants
a white-thorn hedge round it, and sets an oak at every rod distance,
which is consented to by a kind of general courtesy from
one neighbour to another.”<a name="Anchor_34" id="Anchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Two Acts incidentally show to what an extent such hedges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
enclosed lands belonging to two or more proprietors. One
Norfolk Act has the provision, “All enclosures where two or
more proprietors are connected and where the property is not
separated by a hedge or ditch shall be deemed to be Common
Field.” The same clause differently expressed occurs in the
<cite>Act for Ormesby and Scratby (1842, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 9)</cite>: “All old enclosures
within the said parishes in which there are lands belonging to
different proprietors, shall be deemed to be open Fields.”</p>

<p>One of the most striking and interesting features of the open
field village life is the existence of a self-governing constitution
for the settlement of disputes, and the most profitable use of
the village lands&mdash;the annual meetings of farmers and common-right
owners; the institution of field reeves and field juries;
the division among commoners of the profits of the common
property. One cannot but look upon this as the survival
of an ancient village communal life, which must have been
much stronger and more vigorous in earlier days, when each
village was more of a self-contained and isolated economic unit;
and particularly while the co-operative ploughing persisted, from
which the intermixture of lands in common field arable is
admitted to have originated. Even in its degenerate state,
when co-operative ploughing has been extinct for generations,
the open field parish involves a certain partnership among the
cultivators, necessitating some recognised rules, mutual consultation,
and organised combination: how much more binding
the necessity must have been in the Middle Ages? Hence
from the very necessity of the case, there must have been a
bond between the village workers, such as is conveyed by
the words “village community,” which probably preceded, and
underlay as a foundation, the better known manorial and parochial
institutions, the manorial organisation arising from the contact
between the village community and the Central Government, or
outside enemies, the parochial from its contact with the Church.</p>

<p>But while these features of common-field management in
general are survivals of “the village community,” it is possible
<em>in any particular village</em> that such institutions and customs were
the creation of the legislature since the latter part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
eighteenth century. For in the year 1773 a noteworthy Act was
passed for the better regulation of the culture of common arable
fields. It enacts that “where there are open or common field
lands, all the Tillage or Arable lands lying in the said open or
Common Fields, shall be ordered, fenced, cultivated or improved,
in such manner as three-fourths in number and value of the
occupiers shall agree, with consent of the owner and tithe-owner.”</p>

<p>Such agreements were to be binding for six years, or two
<em>rounds</em>, “according to the ancient and established course of
each parish or place”; <i>i.e.</i>, presumably, in a parish where the
ancient customary course had been one crop and a fallow, the
agreement was binding for four years; where it had been three
crops and a fallow, for eight years. Further, every year between
the 21st and 24th of May a field reeve or field reeves were
to be elected. These field reeves, acting under the instructions
of a three-fourths majority in number and value, might delay
the opening of the common fields, might give permission for
any balks, slades or meers (those words are synonyms) to
be ploughed up, an equivalent piece of land being laid down
in common, and boundary stones being put down instead. Since
this Act was designed in the interest of better cultivation, and
for the advantage of the proprietors and large occupiers, special
provision is made that if the cottagers owning common rights
feel themselves prejudiced, they may claim to have a separate
piece of land set out as a common for them.</p>

<p>The effect of the Act was to enable the common-field system
to be adjusted to the new agriculture of the eighteenth century,
which was marked by the introduction of turnips, artificial
grasses, and the abandonment of frequent fallowing. A precise
account of the adoption of a scheme under the Act is given us
by the prime mover.</p>

<p>In the township of Hunmanby, in the East Riding of Yorkshire,
the cultivators had fallen into one of the besetting
temptations to which “champion” farmers were liable. They
had gradually extended the arable fields at the expense of the
common pasture, till the manure produced by the latter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
insufficient for the needs of the former, and the land was losing
its fertility. Isaac Leatham got his brother farmers to agree to
abandon the old (three-year) course of husbandry, and to substitute
the following six-year course:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Turnips, hoed, and fed off with sheep.</li>
<li>2. Barley with grass seed.</li>
<li>3. Grass.</li>
<li>4. Grass.</li>
<li>5. Wheat.</li>
<li>6. Oats or peas.</li>
</ul>

<p>The grass seed sown with the barley was bought in common,
and paid for proportionately. From the time the barley was
carried until it was time to plough for the wheat crop, one
gathers that the grass, which had been sown with the barley,
was being fed with sheep; therefore, at any particular time
after the course was established, half the common field area
was feeding sheep, or growing turnips for sheep, and half was
growing grain or pulse. The sheep flock was managed in
common; each occupier was allowed to contribute sheep to it
in proportion to his holding; the whole was under the care of
two shepherds, who folded the sheep nightly upon different
strips of land in succession, so that all occupiers received equal
benefit. Field reeves were appointed.</p>

<p>“Thus,” says Isaac Leatham, “an open field is enjoyed in
as beneficial a manner as if it were enclosed ... two persons
are fully sufficient to attend the sheep-stock, instead of many ...
the precarious rearing of fences is avoided, and the immense
expense of continually repairing them saved.”<a name="Anchor_35" id="Anchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a></p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>I take it that Isaac Leatham, who, by the way, was a strong
advocate of enclosure in general, meant that the open field was,
<em>on the whole</em>, enjoyed in as beneficial a manner as if it were
enclosed, because there still remained the great disadvantage
that each occupier had his lands in widely scattered strips, and
had to waste much time and labour in cultivating them; cross-ploughing,
which might, or might not have been desirable, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
any way impossible; the village lands had to be treated as one
whole, so no enterprising and original man was able to experiment
with new ideas, nor could any further improvement be
adopted without the consent of a three-fourths majority; and,
perhaps, the keeping of sheep in a common flock put obstacles
in the way of improving the breed.</p>

<p>I may add that an Act for the enclosure of Hunmanby
was passed in the year 1800, so that Isaac Leatham’s course
was abandoned just seven years after he wrote about it so
triumphantly.</p>

<p>The Act of 1773, therefore, was, perhaps, not a brilliant
success in Hunmanby; perhaps, on the other hand, improved
agriculture excited an appetite for further improvement, and
one novelty having been accepted, the stiff conservatism which
might have postponed enclosure, was broken down. But, as
a glance at the map for the East Riding will show, the whole
countryside was subject to a rage for enclosure, and the famine
prices for grain of 1796, doomed to recur again in 1800–1, in
1812, and 1817, were acting as a powerful solvent to all old
agricultural customs.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the Act of 1773 was an endeavour to
select out of the customs and traditions prevailing in different
villages those which were most in harmony with advanced
agriculture, to further amend these, and to make them
universal.</p>

<p>So far as I know, Hunmanby is the only place where it has
been recorded as having been put into execution, and it has
been doubted whether it was not practically a dead letter. My
own impression is that the distribution of the “sicks” at Laxton
was consciously arranged in accordance with the provisions of
the Act, that originally the method of choosing the fallow crops
in Castor and Ailesworth was an application of it, and also the six
years’ course used for part of the fields of Barrowden and Luffenham,
but I can bring no evidence to support this view. If, however,
it is correct, the Act may have been of considerable use
to many other parishes also by clearly defining methods of
procedure which otherwise would be determined by custom only.</p>

<span class="sub_head">ENCLOSURE AND DEPOPULATION.</span></h2>

<p>The very word “enclosure” to a historical student suggests
“depopulation.” The two words are almost treated as synonyms
in Acts of Parliament, tracts, and official documents of the
sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century we find the
proverbs, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Horn and thorn shall make England forlorn</span>,”
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Inclosures make fat beasts and lean poor people</span>,” while the
superstition grew up that inclosed land was cursed, and must
within three generations pass away from the families of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">these
madded and irreligious depopulators</span>,” these “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">dispeoplers of
towns, ruiners of commonwealths, occasioners of beggary ...
cruell inclosiers</span>.”</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the literary attack on enclosure becomes
more feeble, the defence more powerful. W. Wales in 1781,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. Howlett in 1786, published statistics to show that
enclosure had the effect of increasing the population, the latter
tract being widely quoted; there ceased to be any opposition
from the Central Government to enclosure, and private Acts
were passed in continually increasing numbers; finally the one
practical measure carried through by the Board of Agriculture
was the General Enclosure Act of 1801, to simplify and cheapen
Parliamentary proceedings. Dr. Cunningham sums up the case
as follows: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>“He (Joseph Massie) was aware that enclosing had
meant rural depopulation in the sixteenth century, and he too
hastily assumed that the enclosing which had been proceeding
in the eighteenth century was attended with similar results;
but the conditions of the time were entirely changed. Despite
the reiterated allegation,<a name="Anchor_36" id="Anchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> it is impossible to believe that enclosing
in the eighteenth century implied either more pasture
farming or less employment for labour. The prohibition of
export kept down the price of wool; the bounty on exportation
gave direct encouragement to corn-growing; the improved
agriculture gave more employment to labour than the old.”<a name="Anchor_37" id="Anchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a></p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Taken in one sense, I must admit the substantial accuracy of
this opinion. On the other hand I am disposed to maintain the
general accuracy of the statements with regard to depopulation
made by the opponents of enclosure, (<i>a</i>) provided these statements
are understood in the sense in which they are meant,
and (<i>b</i>) statements only with regard to the part of the country
the writer is familiar with are regarded, and his inferences with
regard to other parts are neglected.</p>

<p>For it must be remembered that side by side with the movement
for the enclosure of arable fields, there was going on a
movement for the enclosure of wastes. From <a href="#appendix_a" title="Go to Appendix A.">Appendix A.</a> it will
be seen that 577 Acts for enclosing wastes and common pastures
were passed between 1702 and 1802, and over 800,000 acres
were so added to the cultivated area of England and Wales.
There were besides enclosures occasionally on a large scale by
landed proprietors of wastes on which either common rights
were not exercised, or on which they were too feebly maintained
to necessitate an Act. The Board of Agriculture report for
Notts records that 10,666 acres had recently been so enclosed
from Sherwood Forest alone.<a name="Anchor_38" id="Anchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> Lastly there was the continual
pushing forward of cultivation by farmers, squatters, etc. It is
impossible to do more than form a vague guess as to the
quantity of land so enclosed, but reasons will be given later for
the belief that it was far greater than the area of commons and
waste enclosed by Act of Parliament.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Now the opponents of enclosure of the sixteenth, seventeenth
<em>and</em> eighteenth centuries almost without exception opposed
simply the enclosure of arable common fields; they usually
expressly approve the enclosure of waste, as increasing the
means of subsistence of the people. The advocates of enclosure
on the other hand are equally concerned in advocating both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
kinds of enclosure. Hence we have statements to the effect
that the enclosure of arable fields in the “champion” districts
of England (<i>i.e.</i>, the part much shaded on the <a href="#enclosure" title="Go to the Enclosure Map of England.">map</a>) caused
rural depopulation, met by statistics and arguments to prove
that all kinds of enclosure proceeding over all parts of England
and Wales, on the whole, tended to increase population, urban
and rural. Through looseness of wording on both sides, the
controversialists seem to be contradicting one another; whereas,
in reality, both might equally be right.</p>

<p>At the present day this particular issue is dead, though a
similar question, the question whether by means of the modern
representative of the open field, viz., the allotment field, and
modern representative of the ancient co-operative ploughing,
viz., co-operative purchase of machines, manures and seeds,
borrowing of capital, sale of produce, and perhaps co-operative
stockbreeding, the decay of the agricultural population can be
arrested, is a living issue. Nor is there any period of the
nineteenth century in which any serious rural depopulation as a
result of enclosure, and consequent laying down in pasture, of
common fields, could be asserted. Since Free Trade began to
seriously affect the prices of British grain&mdash;and that was not for
a good many years after 1846&mdash;the common fields have been too
few, and the other forces tending towards rural depopulation too
great, for this particular force to be felt. And if it were felt, no
one would seriously urge that the hardly pressed farmer should
be compelled to cultivate the land in a manner wasteful of labour,
in order that more labourers might be employed. In the earlier
part of the nineteenth century war, protection and a rapidly
growing wealth and population so effectively encouraged tillage
that attempted prohibition of conversion of arable to grass would
have been superfluous.</p>

<p>Yet much, I think, can be learnt on the historical question
from the present aspect of the country, even by anyone who
merely travels by express train through the Midlands. Having
spent a day in traversing the length and breadth of the great
fields of Castor and Ailesworth, yellow with wheat and barley
or recently cut stubble, I went straight through the county of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Northamptonshire, seeing on either side scarcely anything but
permanent pasture. From Northampton to Leicester was the
same thing; again from Leicester to Uppingham. Just beyond
Uppingham the cornfields become far more extensive; what
were the Rutlandshire common fields till 1881 are still mainly
under tillage. All this country of permanent pasture was
mainly enclosed during the eighteenth century. Very frequently
one can see on heavy land the old ridges piled up in the middle,
ending in the middle of one field, crossing hedges, and showing
plainly that very little, if any, ploughing has been done since the
enclosure was effected.<a name="Anchor_39" id="Anchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> The impression made on my mind by
this apparent confirmation of all that the denouncers of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">cruell
Inclosiers</span>” alleged was a very powerful one.</p>

great pasture closes of Northamptonshire: “All this fine grass on so excellent a
soil lies all in the broad ridge and furrow.”
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Before examining the evidence for and against rural depopulation
in particular parts of England as the result of the extinction
of common fields, it is well to consider the <i>a priori</i> arguments
put forward by Dr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>It is urged, in the first place, that owing to the relatively high
price of corn and low price of wool, there was no motive for lay-down
arable as pasture. Dr. Cunningham seems to ignore the
fact that sheep and cattle produce mutton, beef, milk, butter,
cheese, and hides, as well as wool, and it is by the profit to be
derived from all of these products together, and not from any
one of them, that the question of laying down in pasture will be
determined. That laying down arable in pasture was profitable
is indicated by the surprise Arthur Young expressed in 1768
that landlords did not enclose, and put the land to grass, on passing
through Bedfordshire,<a name="Anchor_40" id="Anchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a> and by Adam Smith’s reference in
“The Wealth of Nations” to the exceptional rent commanded
by enclosed pasture.<a name="Anchor_41" id="Anchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> We have, further, the clear statement of
the Board of Agriculture: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>“Whereas the price of corn from
1760 to 1794 was almost stationary, the products of grass land
have risen greatly throughout nearly the whole of that period.”<a name="Anchor_42" id="Anchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a>
William Pitt, again, in a pamphlet published by the Board in
1812 on the “Food Produced from Arable and Grass Land,” says
that through the “increased luxury of the times more beef and
mutton and butter are used than formerly, even by equal numbers,
and consequently more inducement to throw all the best corn to
grass” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35</cite>). William Culley adds in a footnote that “In the
Northern Counties more rent per acre is given for ploughing
than for grazing farms ... more rent is given for grazing than
for arable farms in the Southern Counties.” If this was so
when famine prices were paid for wheat, how much more in
normal times?</p>

  </ul>
</div>

<p>It is said, in the second place, that “the new agriculture gave
more employment to labour than the old.” No doubt such an
improvement as the substitution of well-hoed turnips for a
fallow, the sowing of grass seeds with barley so as to produce a
second crop, or feed for cattle after the barley was carried, both
gave increased employment to labour, and tended to increased
prosperity for the labouring as well as other classes. But these
changes, as we have seen, and as Dr. Cunningham himself
points out, might take place independently of enclosure, and might
not follow if enclosure did take place. Whether they usually
did follow upon enclosure is a question that has to be settled by
an appeal to contemporary evidence. In taking this evidence
reference must always be carefully made to the <em>time</em> and the
<em>place</em>.</p>

<p><cite>The Board of Agriculture’s General Report on Enclosures
(1808)</cite> quotes with approval an anonymous pamphlet published
in 1772: “<cite>The advantages and disadvantages of enclosing waste
lands and common fields</cite>,” by “A Country Gentleman.” This
tract appears to be a very able and impartial attempt to estimate
the effects of enclosure on all the classes interested. The way in
which Acts then originated, and the manner in which proposals
were received, is described thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>“The landowner, seeing the great increase of rent made by
his neighbour, conceives a desire of following his example; the
village is alarmed; the great farmer dreads an increase of rent,
and being constrained to a system of agriculture which neither
his experience nor his inclination tempt him into; the small
farmer, that his farm will be taken from him and consolidated
with the larger; the cottager not only expects to lose his
commons, but the inheritable consequence of the diminution
of labour, the being obliged to quit his native place in search of
work; the inhabitants of the larger towns, a scarcity of
provisions; and the Kingdom in general, the loss of inhabitants”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1</cite>).</p>

<p>The general conclusion seems to be that all these anticipations
and fears, with the exception of the last two&mdash;a scarcity of
provisions for large towns, and a general loss of inhabitants for
the kingdom, are well founded. With regard to the landowner
and tithe-owner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There can be no dispute that it is the landowners’ interest
to promote inclosures; but I verily believe, the improprietor of
tithes reaps the greatest proportional benefit, whilst the small
freeholder, from his expenses increasing inversely to the smallness
of his allotment, undoubtedly receives the least” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 25</cite>).<a name="Anchor_43" id="Anchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43" href="#Anchor_43" title="Return to text.">[43]</a> This is badly expressed. He refers to the fact that a small allotment is
more expensive to fence, proportionally to its size, than a large one.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Of the small farmer:&mdash;“Indeed I doubt it is too true, he
must of necessity give over farming, and betake himself to
labour for the support of his family” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31</cite>).</p>

<p>With regard to the increase or diminution of employment
for labourers, he gives the following statistical table, an estimate
based on his observation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap">It will be seen that his observation is that enclosed arable
employs 16¼ families per 1000 acres, open field arable 20 families
per 1000 acres; that common pastures, heaths, wastes, etc.,
employ only 1 family per 2000 acres; but enclosed pasture
employs 5 families per 1000 acres. It will also be seen that
his observation is that after enclosure rich land becomes
pasture, inferior land arable.<a name="Anchor_44" id="Anchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a></p>

      <a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44" href="#Anchor_44" title="Return to text.">[44]</a> This is in harmony with all other eighteenth century information with
regard to the Midland Counties. As one example we may cite the Vale of
Belvoir, the north-eastern corner of Leicestershire. Here, in consequence of
enclosure, “all the richest land in the vale, formerly under tillage, was laid
down in grass, but the skirtings of the Vale, formerly sheep-walk, were brought
into tillage.” The landlord, the Duke of Rutland, forbade any land worth
more than a guinea per acre to be tilled. The enclosure of the twelve parishes
in the Vale took place between 1766 and 1792. (<cite>William Pitt, “Agriculture of
Leicestershire,” 1809</cite>.)

<p>With regard to the effect of this on population, he names in
one passage<a name="Anchor_45" id="Anchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire
perhaps, as containing “an infinitely greater proportion
of common fields, while Northumberland, Westmoreland and
Yorkshire exceed in moors, heaths and commons,” and in
another he mentions Oxfordshire, Buckingham, Northamptonshire
and part of Leicester as counties in which rich arable
land would be the main subject of an Enclosure Act. A typical
parish in this district might include 1000 acres of rich arable
land, 500 acres of inferior arable, 500 acres of stinted common,
with no heath or waste. Before enclosure it would provide
employment for 30¼ labouring families according to the table,
after enclosure to 15⅝. If eight such parishes were enclosed,
117 families would be sent adrift&mdash;families of poor and ignorant
labourers, looking for new homes under all the disabilities and
difficulties springing from Acts of Settlement, and a Poor Law
administration based on the assumption that those who wander
from their native place are all that is implied in the words
“vagrants” and “vagabonds.” Not eight, but a hundred and
twenty-six Acts for enclosing common fields were passed for the
four counties he names in the ten years 1762–1772, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
preceding the publication of this pamphlet. Assuming the
accuracy of the “<cite>Country Gentleman’s</cite>” statement, this would
mean that some 1800 odd families, comprising about 9000
individuals, would, in consequence of enclosure, be sent adrift in
that short period in the four counties. The quotations given
below from three other authors, indicate that even this was an
under-statement. The process continued without intermission
for many years afterwards.</p>

<p>On the general question the writer says:&mdash;“To obtain an
Act of Parliament to inclose a common field, two witnesses are
produced, to swear that the lands thereof, in their present state,
are not worth occupying, though at the same time they are
lands of the best soil in the kingdom, and produce corn in the
greatest abundance, and of the best quality. And by inclosing
such lands, they are generally prevented from producing any
corn at all, as the landowner converts twenty small farms into
about four large ones, and at the same time the tenants of
those large farms are tied down in their leases not to plough
any of the premises, so lett to farm,<a name="Anchor_46" id="Anchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> by which means of several
hundred villages, that forty years ago contained between four
and five hundred inhabitants, very few will now be found to
exceed eighty, and some not half that number; nay some contain
only one poor decripid man or woman, housed by the
occupiers of lands who live in another parish, to prevent them
being obliged to pay towards the support of the poor who live in
the next parish” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 2</cite>).</p>

<p>The profit of enclosing, he maintains, was dependent upon
simultaneous conversion into pasture, for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>“In some places the
lands inclosed do not answer the ends of pasturage, and in
that case tillage is still to be pursued; because the rents
cannot be raised so high as in respect of pasturage, therefore
the landowner has not the advantage as in case the land turns
out fit for pasturage, and is oftener the loser by that proceeding
than the gainer.”<a name="Anchor_46a" id="Anchor_46a" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a></p>

<p>The particular enclosure he cites is that of a parish enclosed
about forty years previously. Before enclosure it contained
eighty-two houses, of which twenty were small farms and forty-two
were cottages with common rights. It had 1800 acres of
common field arable, 200 acres of rich common cow pasture,
and 200 acres of meadow, commonable after hay harvest. The
common pasture fed two hundred milch cows and sixty dry ones
till hay harvest, at which time they were turned into the
meadows, and their place taken by about one hundred horses.
Twelve hundred sheep were fed on the stubbles.</p>

<p>An even more striking example of local depopulation caused
by enclosure is supplied by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Howlett, one of the
strongest advocates of enclosure. He quotes from a private
correspondent: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>“As to Inclosure, I can mention two villages in
this County (Leicestershire) within two miles of each other,
Wistow and Foston,<a name="Anchor_48" id="Anchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a> which formerly contained thirty-four or
thirty-five dwellings, but by enclosure Foston is reduced to
three habitations: the parsonage house accommodates one
family, and the two other buildings are occupied by shepherds,
who manage the stock for their different renters, as the whole
of the parish belongs to one person. And as to Wistow, the
thirty-four mansions have vanished in a very few years, and no
dwelling remains but the late Sir Charles Halford’s hall house,
who owns the lordship; and these are called improvements, for
double or treble rents ensue.” (<cite>“Enclosures and Depopulation,”

<p>What became of these farmers and labourers? The “<cite>Country
Farmer</cite>” says: “Many of the small farmers who have been
deprived of their livelihood have sold their stock-in-trade and
have raised from <abbr title="50 pounds">£50</abbr> to <abbr title="100 pounds">£100</abbr>, with which they have procured
themselves, their families, and money, a passage to America.”</p>

<p>John Wedge, the Board of Agriculture reporter for Warwick,
says seven years later: “About forty years ago the southern and
eastern parts of this county consisted mostly of open fields.
There are still about 50,000 acres of open field land, which in a
few years will probably all be inclosed.... These lands being
now grazed want much fewer hands to manage them than they
did in the former open state. Upon all enclosures of open fields
the farms have generally been made much larger; from these
causes the hardy yeomanry of country villages have been driven
for employment to Birmingham, Coventry, and other manufacturing
towns.”<a name="Anchor_49" id="Anchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> Such information, given by the representative
of an enclosure-advocating corporation, circulated among the

<p>The rising industries of Birmingham and other Midland towns
found employment, no doubt, for many of the exiles from the
villages. On the whole, the ruling opinion seems to have
found all this very satisfactory. The gross produce of food by
these Midland parishes might be diminished on enclosure, but
the net produce, as was shown by the increase of rent, certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
increased, and an abundant supply of labour was furnished for
those metal working industries which were of the greatest
importance in times of war.<a name="Anchor_50" id="Anchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> When we think of the horrible
sanitary conditions of English towns during the eighteenth

of Colquhoun’s attempts at a statistical account of London

of the terrible fact that right through the eighteenth century
the deaths “within the bills of mortality” regularly far exceeded
the births, we feel that there was another side to the shield,
though possibly the sanitary and social condition of Midland
towns was less terrible than that of London.</p>

<p>The connection between enclosure of common fields and rising
poor rates in the eighteenth century is illustrated repeatedly in
Eden’s “Condition of the Poor.”</p>

<p>In Buckinghamshire we find the two neighbouring parishes of
Maids Morton and Winslow. The former contained 30 acres of
old enclosure, 60 to 70 acres of commons, and the rest of the
parish, about 800 acres, was common field. The poor-rates in
the years 1792 to 1795 were <abbr title="3 shillings and 6 pence">3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr>, <abbr title="3 shillings">3<i>s.</i></abbr>, <abbr title="3 shillings">3<i>s.</i></abbr>, <abbr title="3 shillings and 6 pence">3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> There
were “several roundsmen.” Wages were nominally <abbr title="1 shilling">1<i>s.</i></abbr> to
<abbr title="1 shilling and 2 pence">1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></abbr> per day, but piecework was general, and <abbr title="1 shilling and 3 pence">1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="1 shilling and 6 pence">1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr>
was generally earned. The rent of farms varied from <abbr title="17 pounds">£17</abbr> to
<abbr title="90 pounds">£90</abbr> per farm, and from <abbr title="18 shillings">18<i>s.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre.</p>

<p>Winslow contained 1400 acres, and was entirely enclosed in
1744 and 1766. Only 200 acres remained arable. The farms
varied from <abbr title="60 pounds">£60</abbr> to <abbr title="400 pounds">£400</abbr> per annum each, the wages were <abbr title="6 shillings">6<i>s.</i></abbr> to
<abbr title="7 shillings">7<i>s.</i></abbr> per week, “most of the labourers are on rounds,” and the
poor rates from 1792 to 1795 were <abbr title="5 shillings and 8 pence">5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr>, <abbr title="4 shillings">4<i>s.</i></abbr>, <abbr title="5 shillings">5<i>s.</i></abbr>, and <abbr title="6 shillings">6<i>s.</i></abbr>
“The rise of the Rates is chiefly ascribed to the Enclosure of
common fields; which it is said has lessened the number of
farms, and from the conversion of arable into pasture, has much
reduced the demand for labourers. An old man of the parish
says, before the enclosures took place, land did not let for <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr>
per acre.” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 27–33</cite>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>In judging the rise of poor rate, it must not be forgotten that
where the rent rises at the same time as the nominal rate, the
sum of money actually raised for Poor Law purposes is increased
in a greater ratio than the nominal poor rate. If, for example,
by enclosure the rental of a parish is increased 50 per cent.,
but the poor rate doubled, the yield of the poor rate is increased
threefold. And if a considerable number of labourers are driven
elsewhere, the amount of destitution produced by the change
is far greater even than that indicated by a threefold increase
in the amount of relief given.</p>

<p>The latter side of the process is illustrated in the case of
Deddington in Oxfordshire. Here, “the high rates in this
parish are ascribed to the common field of which the land principally
consists; whereas the neighbouring parishes have been
enclosed many years, and many small farms in them have
been consolidated; so that many small farmers with little capitals
have been obliged, either to turn labourers or to procure small
farms in Deddington, or other parishes that possess common
fields. Besides this, the neighbouring parishes are, many of
them, possessed by a few individuals, who are cautious in permitting
new comers to obtain a settlement.” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 891</cite>.)</p>

<p>In Leicestershire the complaint is naturally more loud and
general. In the account of Kibworth Beauchamp we read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>“No account of the Rates in any of the divisions, previous
to the enclosure of the common fields, can be obtained;
but it is said that they were not one-third of what they are at
present; and the people attribute the rise to the enclosures; for
they say ‘That before the fields were enclosed, they were solely
applied to the production of corn; that the poor had then plenty
of employment in weeding, reaping, threshing, etc., and could also
collect a great quantity of corn by gleaning; but that the fields
being now in pasturage, the farmers have little occasion for
labourers, and the poor being thereby thrown out of employment,
must of course be employed by the parish.’  There is
some truth in these observations: <em>one-third or perhaps one-fourth</em>
of the number of hands which were required twenty
years ago, would now be sufficient, according to the present
system of agriculture, to perform all the farming work of the
parish.”</p>

<p>He adds that if it were not for the fact that many labourers
were getting employment in canal cutting, the rates would be
much higher still, and “the tradesmen, small farmers, and
labourers are very loud in their complaints against those whom
they call monopolising farmers and graziers, an evil which, they
say, increases every year.” (<cite><abbr title="Volume 2">Vol. II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 383</cite>.)</p>

<p>In Northamptonshire we find the case of Brixworth, enclosed
in 1780, a parish of 3300 acres. Before enclosure it consisted
almost entirely of common fields. At the time of Eden’s writing,
sixteen years later, only one-third remained arable. The expenditure
on the poor in 1776, before the enclosure, was <abbr title="121 pounds 6 shillings">£121 6<i>s.</i></abbr>, in the
six years 1787 to 1792 it averaged <abbr title="325 pounds">£325</abbr> (<cite><abbr title="Volume 2">Vol. II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 529</cite>).
Again, with regard to local urban opinion, he notes that “the
lands round Kettering are chiefly open field: they produce rich
crops of corn. The people of the town seem averse to enclosures,
which they think will raise the price of provisions, from
these lands being all turned to pasture, when inclosed, as was
the case in Leicestershire, which was a great corn country, and
is now, almost entirely, converted into pasture.”</p>

<p>Arthur Young, a little more than twenty years previously (in
“<cite>Political Arithmetic</cite>,” published in 1774), while arguing in
favour of enclosure on the depopulation count, makes an
admission against it with regard to pauperism. “Very many of
the labouring poor have become chargeable to their parishes,
but this has nothing to do with depopulation; on the contrary,
the constantly seeing such vast sums distributed in this way,
must be an inducement to marriage among all the idle poor&mdash;and
certainly has proved so.” (<cite><abbr title="Pages">Pp.</abbr> 75, 76</cite>.)</p>

<p>As a general rule it may be said that where after enclosure
pasturage was increased at the expense of tillage, rural depopulation
resulted; where the amount of land under tillage was
increased the rural population increased. Further, that
enclosure in the northern and western parts of England in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries increased the area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
under tillage; that the balance between the production of bread
and meat for the whole country, so disturbed, was maintained
by the conversion into pasture, on enclosure, of much of the
“champion” corn growing land, particularly in those midland
counties nearest to the northern and western ones in which the
complementary change was taking place. By means of the
Enclosure Acts, interpreted by the light of the above statements,
we can trace these two compensating movements through the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The following passage in Arthur Young’s “<cite>Political
Arithmetic</cite>,” published in 1774, at the time, that is, when
he was an eager advocate not only of enclosure of all sorts, but
also of the engrossing of farms and the raising of rents, sums
up the two movements:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The fact is this: in the central counties of the kingdom,
particularly Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, and parts of
Warwick, Huntingdonshire, and Buckinghamshire, there have
been within thirty years large tracts of the open field arable under
that vile course, 1. fallow, 2. wheat, 3. spring corn, inclosed and
laid down to grass, being much more suited to the wetness of
the soil than corn.” Here he admits local depopulation takes
place, though he claims that a greater <i>net</i> produce is, as the
result of enclosure, supplied by such districts to the rest of the
kingdom. But then, he asks with regard to the opponents of
such enclosure, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>“What will they say to the inclosures in
<i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Nottinghamshire</i>, <i>Derbyshire</i>, <i>Lincolnshire</i>,
<i>Yorkshire</i> and all the northern counties? What say they to
the sands of <i>Norfolk, Suffolk and Nottinghamshire</i>, which yield
corn and mutton from <em>the force of <span class="smcap">Inclosure</span> alone</em>? What
say they to the Wolds of <i>York</i> and <i>Lincoln</i>, which from barren
heaths at <abbr title="1 shilling">1<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre, are <em>by <span class="smcap">Inclosure</span> alone</em> rendered profitable
farms? Ask <i>Sir Cecil Wray</i> if without Inclosure he could
advance his heaths by sainfoine from <abbr title="1 shilling">1<i>s.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> an acre:&mdash;What
say they to the vast tracts in the peak of Derby which <em>by
<span class="smcap">Inclosure</span> alone</em> are changed from black regions of ling to
fertile fields covered with cattle? What say they to the
improvements of moors in the northern counties, where
<span class="smcap">Inclosures</span> alone have made these countries smile with culture
which before were black as night?”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to ridicule the view of his opponents, that
the enclosure of waste, though desirable in itself, should as far
as possible be so conducted as to create small farms and small
properties, a view with which in later years, and after his tour
in France, he very much sympathised. Into the merits of this
controversy we need not go; what we have to note here is
Arthur Young’s evidence to the fact that from about 1744 to
1774 there was simultaneously proceeding a rapid enclosure of
waste in Norfolk, Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire,
and Lincolnshire and the northern counties, by which the
acreage under tillage was vastly increased, and a compensating
enclosure of arable common fields in Northamptonshire,
Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Huntingdonshire and Buckinghamshire,
involving the conversion of arable to pasture, of small
farms into much larger ones, and of the peasantry into urban
labourers.</p>

<p>It only remains to be added that the former movement, if it
was on at all as great a scale as Arthur Young gives us to
understand (and I don’t see why one should doubt this) must
have proceeded largely, if not mainly, without the intervention
of Parliament. This is in the first place antecedently probable.
Secondly, whereas between 1727 and 1774 there were 273
common field parishes enclosed by Acts of Parliament in the
five counties of Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Warwick,
Huntingdonshire and Buckinghamshire, the commons, fens,
moors, etc., attached to only 109 parishes in Norfolk, Suffolk,
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Durham
and Northumberland were so enclosed. Unless the area of
about 100,000 acres thus enclosed in these 109 parishes was
merely a fraction of the total area of waste enclosed by all sorts
of methods in this latter group of counties, Arthur Young was
misleading his readers, for he certainly intends to give the
impression that the enclosure of arable fields in the Midlands
was on a much smaller scale than the reclamation of heaths,
moors and fens in the northern and eastern counties. Thirdly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
with regard to Norfolk, Arthur Young specifies enclosure without
Acts of Parliament as one of the causes of the great
agricultural improvement in parts of Norfolk (<cite>“Eastern Tour,”
1771, <abbr title="Volume 2">Vol. II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 150</cite>):&mdash;“From forty to sixty years ago, all the
Northern and Western and a great part of the Eastern tracts of
the country were sheep-walks, let so low as from <abbr title="6 pence">6<i>d.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="1 shilling and 6 pence">1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr>
and <abbr title="2 shillings">2<i>s.</i></abbr> an acre. Much of it was in this condition only thirty
years ago. The great improvements have been made by reason
of the following circumstances:&mdash;(1) By inclosing without
assistance of Parliament.”</p>

<p>Six other reasons follow, then the remark: “Parliamentary
enclosures are scarcely ever so complete and general as in
Norfolk,” <i>i.e.</i>, as the enclosures without the assistance of
Parliament in Norfolk. I have only been able to find eleven
Acts of Enclosure for Norfolk before 1771; seven of these were
for the enclosure of common field parishes, and four for the
enclosure of waste. In other words, the Parliamentary enclosure
of these sheep-walks at the time when Arthur Young wrote had
proceeded to a merely trifling extent.</p>

<p>We have, then, by Arthur Young’s confession, in the five
counties of Northampton, Leicester, Warwick, Huntingdon, and
Buckingham enclosure admittedly accompanied by decay of
tillage and rural depopulation. From “A Country Gentleman’s”
list we can add Oxfordshire and parts of Lincolnshire. That the
same prevailing economic motive operated in Bedfordshire can
be shown from Arthur Young’s “Tour through the North of
England.” The country in June, 1768, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neots to
Kimbolton was in general open&mdash;“the open fields let at <abbr title="7 shillings">7<i>s.</i></abbr> and
<abbr title="7 shillings and 6 pence">7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> per acre, and the <em>inclosed pastures</em> about <abbr title="17 shillings">17<i>s.</i></abbr> Hence we
find a profit of <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> an acre <em>by inclosing and laying to grass</em>.”
He might here ask, as he does with regard to the district
in Buckinghamshire between Aylesbury and Buckingham, which
he found in 1771 in the condition of open field arable, under a
course of fallow, wheat, beans, fallow, barley, beans. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>“As to
the landlords, what in the name of wonder can be the reason of
their not inclosing! All this vale would make as fine meadows
as any in the world.”</p>

<p>As for Gloucestershire, <cite>William Marshall (“Rural Economy
of Gloucestershire,” 1789, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 21)</cite>, estimates the rents in the Vale
of Evesham at <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="15 shillings">15<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre for common field arable,
<abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre for enclosed arable, and <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="50 shillings">50<i>s.</i></abbr> per
acre for enclosed pasture. Here again there can be no doubt that
enclosure implied laying down at least all the good land in grass.</p>

<p>A Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed
to consider the high prices of food in December, 1800 (1800
and 1801 being famine years), made enquiry, by the help of the
parish clergy, into the increase or decrease of land under different
crops, and of cattle, sheep, and pigs in the districts which had
been enclosed in the previous 45 years by private Acts (<i>i.e.</i>, since
1755). The total result showed a net gain in area under wheat
in 1,767,651 acres enclosed of 10,625 acres; the area under
wheat being before enclosure 155,572 acres; after, 165,837 acres.
But these figures included all sorts of enclosure. The Board of
Agriculture (<cite>“<abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Report,” <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 39 and 232</cite>), by leaving out
cases where waste only was enclosed, obtained the following
result for cases of enclosure of all commonable lands, under Acts
passed between 1761 and 1799, in parishes where commonable
arable was included. Taking the counties in groups we have:&mdash;</p>

<p>In estimating the significance of these figures it must be
borne in mind that the figures for acreage in wheat after
enclosure were collected at a time of famine prices for wheat.
Probably many thousands of acres of old arable common field,
which had been enclosed and laid down in grass, in each of these
counties, were again ploughed under the stimulus of wheat prices
exceeding <abbr title="100 shillings">100<i>s.</i></abbr> per quarter.</p>

<p>So much with regard to the connexion between depopulation
and enclosure in the second half of the eighteenth century.
With regard to the first half, the following account is supplied
by a certain John Cowper, <cite>“Inclosing Commons and Common
field lands is contrary to the interest of the Nation” (1732)</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When these commons come to be inclosed and converted
into pasture, the Ruin of the Poor is a natural consequence; they
being bought out by the lord of the <em>Manor</em>, or some other person
of substance.</p>

<p>“In most open field parishes there are at a medium 40 farmers
and 80 cottagers who hold their lands in common, and have
right of commonage one with another. Suppose each person
employs 6 labourers, we have in all 660 persons, men, women
and children, who besides their Employment in Husbandry, carry
on large branches of the Woollen and Linnen Manufactures.”</p>

<p>With regard to the plea that hedging and ditching will employ
many hands, he says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>“This is so contrary to constant experience,
that it hardly deserves to be taken notice of. I myself, within
these 30 years past, have seen above 20 Lordships or
Parishes inclosed, and everyone of them has been in a manner
depopulated. If we take all the inclosed Parishes one with
another, we shall find hardly ten inhabitants remaining, where
there were an hundred before Inclosures were made. And in
some parishes 120 families of Farmers and Cottagers, have in a
few years been reduced to four, to two, aye, and sometimes to but
one family. And if this practice of inclosing continues much
longer, we may expect to see all the great estates ingrossed by a
few Hands, and the industrious Farmers and Cottagers almost
intirely rooted out of the kingdom. Raising Hedges and sinking
ditches may indeed employ several hands for a year, or hardly so
long, but when that is once over, the work is at an end....
Owners of inclosed Lands, if they have but a little corn to get in,
are already forced to send several miles to open field parishes for
Harvest men.”</p>

<p>Six open field farms, averaging 150 acres each, and the little
holdings of twelve cottagers, would be let together, after enclosure,
as one grazing farm, and the total rent thus be raised from <abbr title="300 pounds">£300</abbr>
to <abbr title="600 pounds">£600</abbr>. But whereas one acre of arable land would previously
have produced 20 bushels at <abbr title="3 shillings">3<i>s.</i></abbr> per bushel, a gross return of <abbr title="3 pounds">£3</abbr>;
after enclosure it would contribute to the fattening of a bullock to
the extent of <abbr title="25 shillings">25<i>s.</i></abbr> The gross produce is decreased; but the net
produce is increased. Of the <abbr title="3 pounds">£3</abbr> produced by the acre of common
field under wheat, <abbr title="50 shillings">50<i>s.</i></abbr> would go in expenses, leaving <abbr title="6 shillings and 8 pence">6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr> to
the landlord and <abbr title="3 shillings and 4 pence">3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></abbr> to the tenant. Of the <abbr title="25 shillings">25<i>s.</i></abbr> produced by
the same acre enclosed under grass, <abbr title="13 shillings and 4 pence">13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></abbr> would go to the
landlord, <abbr title="11 shillings and 8 pence">11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr> to the grazier.</p>

<p>It is interesting in passing to note the association of common
field agriculture with manufacture in the domestic stage indicated
by this passage.</p>

<p>We have also direct evidence of the same movements in the
seventeenth century. On the one hand Walter Blyth (<cite>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The
English Improver,</span>” 1649, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40</cite>) has the passage:&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Consider but
the Woodlands, who before Enclosure, were wont to be relieved by
the Fieldon, with corne of all sorts. And now growne as gallant
Corne Countries as be in England, as the Western part of
Warwickshire, and the northern parts of Worcestershire,
Staffordshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and all the
countries thereabouts.</span>” On the other hand, from the controversy
between the two John Moores on the one hand, and Joseph Lee
and an anonymous controversialist on the other, we can pick out
certain statements of matters of fact that passed uncontradicted.</p>

<p>This controversy arose out of the enclosure of Catthorp, a
parish in the extreme south-west corner of Leicestershire,
bordering on Northamptonshire and Warwickshire. Lee was
the parish priest of Catthorp, and a party to the enclosure. In
his “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Vindication of Regulated Inclosure,</span>” he gives a list of
fifteen parishes within three miles of Catthorp which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
enclosed. He also gives a list of nineteen parishes, enclosed from
twenty to fifty years, in which depopulation had not yet taken
place. This second list, as John Moore remarks, <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">“they were
forced to fish up out of the counties of Leicester, Warwick,
Northampton, etc.,</span>” and it is significant that two only of the
fifteen parishes enclosed near Catthorp are asserted by Lee not
to have been attended by depopulation. If we go a little earlier
we find in 1607 an insurrection against enclosures, followed by a
searching enquiry by James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s government, and no doubt by
renewed vigilance, for a while, in the enforcement of the
Depopulation Acts. It may be regarded as axiomatic that
in a corn-growing country,<a name="Anchor_51" id="Anchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> enclosure which does not diminish
tillage, does not provoke riot and insurrection.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51" href="#Anchor_51" title="Return to text.">[51]</a> Riots may occur on the enclosure of waste, where the enclosed waste gave a
livelihood to a considerable specialised population, as in Hatfield Chase and the
Fens. See <cite>Dr. Cunningham’s “Growth of English Industry and Commerce,”
<abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 187, 188</cite>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>While, however, enclosure which does not diminish the land
under tillage does not, as a rule, cause rural depopulation, it is a
rule not altogether without exception. One of the most striking
passages in <cite>Cobbett’s “Rural Rides”</cite> is that written in August,
1826, in which he describes the valley of the Wiltshire Avon:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>“It is manifest enough, that the population of this valley
was, at one time, many times over what it is now; for, in the
first place, what were the twenty-nine churches built for? The
population of the twenty-nine parishes is now but little more than
one-half of the single parish of Kensington,<a name="Anchor_52" id="Anchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> and there are several
of the churches bigger than the church at Kensington.... In
three instances, Fifield, Milston, and Roach-Fen, the <em>church
porches</em> would hold all the inhabitants, even down to the bedridden
and the babies. What then, will any man believe that
these churches were built for such little knots of people?...
But, in fact, you plainly see all the traces of a great ancient
population. The churches were almost all large, and built in
the best manner. Many of them are very fine edifices; very
costly in the building; and, in the cases where the body of the
church has been altered in the repairing of it, so as to make it
smaller, the tower, which everywhere defies the hostility of
time, shows you what the church must formerly have been....
There are now no less than nine of the parishes out of the
twenty-nine, that have either no parsonage houses or have such
as are in such a state that a parson will not, or cannot, live in
them.... The land remains, and the crops and the sheep
come as abundantly as ever; but they are now sent almost wholly
away.... In the distance of about thirty miles, there stood
fifty mansion houses. Where are they now? I believe there
are but eight, that are at all worthy of the name of mansion
houses.... In taking my leave of this beautiful vale I have to
express my deep shame, as an Englishman, at beholding the
general extreme poverty of those who cause this vale to produce
such quantities of food and raiment. This is, I verily believe it,
the worst-used labouring population upon the face of the earth.”<a name="Anchor_53" id="Anchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a></p>

<p>When Cobbett wrote, the process of Enclosure for this corner
of Wiltshire was practically complete. Thomas Davis, whose
account of the agriculture of Wiltshire is the most interesting
of the whole series of county surveys, wrote when the process
was in its early stage, and wrote predicting depopulation. He
says, “The greater part of this country was formerly, and at no
very remote period, in the hands of great proprietors. Almost
every manor had its resident lord, who held part of the lands in
demesne, and granted out the rest by copy or lease to under
tenants, usually for three lives renewable. A state of commonage,
and particularly of open common fields, was particularly favourable
to this tenure.... The north-west of Wiltshire being
much better adapted to inclosures and to sub-division of property,
than the rest, was inclosed first; while the south-east, or Down
district, has undergone few inclosures and still fewer sub-divisions.”<a name="Anchor_54" id="Anchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a></p>

at about <abbr title="20 pounds">£20</abbr> a year each. A typical yardland consisted,<a name="Anchor_56" id="Anchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> besides
the homestead, of 2 acres of meadow, 18 acres in the arable
fields, usually in 18 to 20 pieces, a right on the common meadows,
common fields, and downs for forty sheep, and as many cattle as
the tenant could winter with the fodder he grew.<a name="Anchor_57" id="Anchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> His forty
sheep were kept with those of his neighbours, in the common
flock of the manor, in charge of the common shepherd. They
were taken every day to the downs, and brought back every
night to be folded on the arable fields, the usual rule being to
fold one thousand sheep on a “tenantry” acre (but ¾ of a
statute acre) per night. In breeding sheep regard was had to
what may be termed folding quality (<i>i.e.</i>, the propensity to drop
manure only after being folded at night) as much as to quality or

<p>On the enclosure of such a manor the common flock was
broken up, and the position of the small farmer became untenable.
It is true, says our author, that he has the convenience of having
his arable land in fewer pieces; but if he has his 18 acres all in
one piece instead of in 20, he cannot plough them with fewer
than the three horses he previously ploughed with. Then he
has no enclosure to put his horses in; he no longer has the
common to turn them on. His right on the down would entitle
him to an allotment of sheepdown of about 20 acres, perhaps
two miles from home. This is too small for him to be able to
take it up, so he accepts instead an increase of arable land. But
now he has no down on which to feed his sheep, no common
shepherd to take charge of his sheep, which are too few to
enable him individually to employ a shepherd. He, therefore,
must part with his flock and then has no sheep to manure his land;
further, having no cow-common, and very little pasture land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
he cannot keep cows to make dung with his straw. Lastly,
the arable land being in general entirely unsuited to turn to
grass, he is prevented from enclosing his allotment, and laying
it down in pasture.<a name="Anchor_59" id="Anchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> Obviously in such circumstances the small
farmer, after for a few years raising diminishing crops from his
impoverished arable land, must succumb, and in some cases help
as a labourer to till his fields for another man, in other cases
drift to the towns or enlist.</p>

<p>The contemporaneous decay of rural manufacturing industry,<a name="Anchor_60" id="Anchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a>
of course, greatly aggravated the depopulating effects of
enclosure. It may even have precipitated enclosure by weakening
the position of the small farmer during the period of the
French wars: during a time, that is, in which a combination of
causes, apart from enclosure, was favouring the extension of
large farms at the expense of small farms.<a name="Anchor_61" id="Anchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a></p>

<p>In the south-east of Wiltshire, then, enclosure was followed
by no increase of pasture farming, but it was followed by local
depopulation. Whether the depopulation was merely local, or
national as well, would depend upon whether, after enclosure,
the total production of food of the parish were increased or
diminished. Thomas Davis tells us that in many cases it was
diminished, the reason, no doubt, being that there was a lack of
farmers with sufficient enterprise and control of capital to absorb
the small farms, as their occupiers began to drift towards bankruptcy.
That such a result as this was felt to be an impending
danger is shown by his statement:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>“In some late inclosures
allotments of arable land to small farmers have been set out
adjoining to each other, directing the same to remain in an
uninclosed state with a common right of sheep-feed over the
whole, and a common allotment of down land and another of
water-meadows, and some inclosed pasture to each if necessary.”</p>

<p>In this district, consisting of open downs, stretching for miles
along the summits and higher slopes of the chalk hills; intersected
by winding rivers bordered by flat alluvial land of naturally
rich pasture, but converted by irrigation into the famous Wiltshire
water meadows, the long lower slopes of the hills, as it
were, decreed by nature to be noble corn fields, cultivation had
to be on a large scale; the unit of cultivation had to be a piece of
land of reasonable width, stretching from the river to the summit
of the downs. Hence small farms could not exist without some
degree of organised mutual help. When that organisation,
which in this district was furnished by the common field system,
was terminated by Enclosure Acts, consolidation of farms became
necessary.</p>

<p>Nowhere else are these conditions present in quite so fully
developed a degree as in Wiltshire, which contains the central
hub from which radiate the three great belts of chalk down, the
South Downs, the North Downs, and the range containing the
Chilterns, the chalk hills of Hertfordshire, the Gog-Magogs of
Cambridgeshire, and their continuation into Norfolk. But the
most essential feature of Wiltshire agriculture, viz., the combination
of sheep down and arable field, may be said to be
characteristic of all this country. This is the country from
which in the sixteenth century came the great indignant outcry
against enclosure, which in More’s “Utopia” enters into the
classic literature of our country. When it is remembered that
the economic motive of enclosure then was the high price of
wool, that private individuals are stated to have owned flocks of
ten thousand, twenty thousand, and even of twenty-four thousand
sheep<a name="Anchor_62" id="Anchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a>, it is easy to conceive of whole parishes being converted
into great sheep runs.</p>

<p class="ch_quote_ref"><span class="smcap">Tusser</span>, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Champion and Several.</span>”</p>

<p>During the nineteenth century the controversy with regard to
enclosure did not turn upon the question whether it did or
did not injure the mass of the rural poor of the locality, in
their capacity of agricultural labourers, by depriving them of
employment; but whether it injured them by depriving
them without compensation of rights which they had enjoyed
before enclosure, but which could not be legally established;
and whether poor owners of common rights have received
compensation: the question, in fact, whether the poor are
justified in “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Grutching at Enclosure</span>,” because of real abuses
in the method of carrying it out. On this question no distinction
need be drawn between the two classes of Enclosure Acts.</p>

<p>I do not think that much complaint can be made with regard
to the administration of the Enclosure Acts since 1876 by the
Board of Agriculture. By the provision of adequate allotment
grounds and recreation grounds compensation is made to those
villagers who can claim no specific rights of common; and
though no doubt many of the owners of single common rights
are dissatisfied with the plots of land assigned to them, there
seems to be no reason for doubting that the Commissioners
appointed have endeavoured to deal with rich and poor with
equal fairness. Further, a great deal of the work of the Board
in its capacity of Enclosure Commissioners has been the regulation
of commons; and to a certain degree they have become a
body for preserving instead of destroying commons. They may
even be described as the most potent force for the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of existing common-fields, simply by insisting on a certain
method in the division and allotment, which may be too
expensive.</p>

<p>But this verdict of “Not guilty” only applies to the enclosure
authority since it was chastened and corrected by the movement
for the preservation of commons. All the early reports of the
Enclosure Commissioners, or the Enclosure, Tithe and Copyhold
Commissioners give abundant evidence of the hard, legal spirit
in which the claims of cottagers were considered, and the slight
reasons which were considered good enough for refusing
recreation grounds and allotments. The twenty-seventh annual
report&mdash;the <i>apologia</i> of the Commissioners&mdash;pleads, as we have
seen above, that 8,000,000 acres of commons, and 1,000,000
acres of commonable arable fields or meadows still existed,
which was absurdly inaccurate, and that “of all modes of tenure
in a fully peopled country there is none more prejudicial to
improved culture than that of holding in common.” Again, the
thirty-second report makes a great deal of the fact that the
590,000 acres of common and commonable land dealt with since
the Act of 1845 had been distributed among 26,000 separate
owners; which, however, only proved that the number of people
who owned rights over unenclosed land had been greater than
the number of owners of a corresponding area of enclosed land&mdash;but
whether that was because commons and common fields
favoured the creation or preservation of small properties (as it
certainly does in many cases), or whether because a multiplicity
of owners favours the preservation of commons and common
fields (which is always the case), no credit was due to the
General Enclosure Act, or to the body administering it.</p>

<p>We find that between 1845 and 1875, out of a total area of
590,000 acres divided and allotted, just 1758 acres were set
aside for recreation grounds, and 2195 acres for field gardens
and allotments. The administration of the Act since 1877 is,
therefore, a very severe condemnation of its administration in
the earlier period.</p>

<p>We have seen in the case of Ewelme and the neighbouring
parishes, how the cottagers were injured on enclosure, by losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
their source of fuel, without getting any compensation. I am
indebted to Mr. John Swain for the following description of the
effects of enclosure of a Welsh mountain.</p>

<p>“The parish of &mdash;&mdash;, in the county of Montgomeryshire, is
about five miles long by two miles broad. It consists for the
most part of a hill, lying between a river and one of its tributaries.
The hill rises to about 900 feet above sea level, and contains no
unenclosed land. We have, therefore, in this parish, two strips
of low-lying meadow land, land of a moderate quality on the hill
slopes, and rough pasture land near the summit. On this hill
most of the cottage holdings are to be found, usually in some
sheltered hollow near a spring or a running stream....</p>

<p>“Previous to the Enclosure Act, passed early in the nineteenth
century, the greater part of the hill was open. The farms
occupied the bottom lands, and the foot of the hill, up which
they crept, their boundary fences forming an irregular line on
the hillside, being higher or lower as the nature and quality of
the land tempted enclosure. The unenclosed portion of the hill
was used as a common pasture by all the farmers whose land
adjoined it, and the amount of stock each one was allowed to
feed on it was roughly regulated by the size of his holding.</p>

<p>“About 120 years ago a number of the poorer peasantry
began settling on this common land. There was a general
understanding that if a house was raised during the night so
that the builders were able to cause smoke to issue from the
chimney by sunrise, they thereby established a right of possession
which none could gainsay. Timber in the neighbouring
woods was abundant and cheap, so an intending squatter had
little difficulty in procuring the material for building his cottage.
With the help of his friends he procured sufficient wood for the
framework, and then selected a convenient site in a sheltered
spot with a southern aspect, and marked down the foundations
of his future dwelling. When all preparations were made he
gathered together all the help he could, and in the dusk of the
evening had all his materials conveyed to the selected spot.
Rough stonework was laid to form the foundations and chimney
end of the cottage, and then the framework was quickly set up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
The panels were interwoven with stout laths, and covered with
clay, over which was smeared a coating of lime-plaster, while a
roof of thatch completed the edifice. Windows were not for a
time considered necessary, but the entrance was carefully
secured by a stout door. Then just as the dawn was breaking,
a fire was kindled on the hearth, and the curl of smoke above
the rude chimney told the workers that they could now relax
their efforts....</p>

<p>“A dwelling-house having been erected, the next step was to
appropriate a few acres of land surrounding it.... The difficulty
of obtaining sufficient land for the keep of a cow was no
more than the labour of enclosing and reclaiming it.</p>

<p>“In this way some thirty or forty families were settled in
cottages built by themselves, around which were three or four
fields, where for many years they lived in undisturbed possession.
By patient labour the gorse and fern were got rid of, trees were
planted round the cottage, or allowed to grow where they sprang
up in suitable places in the hedgerows; by cultivation and
manuring the herbage was improved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>“With the Enclosure Act there came a disturbance of this
state of affairs. The partition of the unappropriated land seems
to have been carried out fairly, by adding to each farm a quantity
of land in proportion to the amount of pasturage the occupier
enjoyed on the common.... When, however, we come to
consider the case of the cottager, his treatment was by no means
fair. Enclosures of over twenty-one years’ standing were not
interfered with, and their owners were left in undisturbed
possession, but such as had been enclosed for a shorter period
were claimed by the Lord of the Manor, who lived some twelve
miles away, and possessed little or no land in the parish. He
advanced his claim cautiously, asking only a nominal rent, and
as unlettered peasants felt the inequality of a contest in the
matter, this rent was paid. Consequently more than half the
cottage holdings fell into his hands, and the poor occupiers were
deprived of the ownership of the dwellings they had erected,
and of all the improvements they had put into the land they had
enclosed. None of them had to leave their holdings, and the
rent at first charged was trifling; but except in cases where
life-leases were granted, the cottagers had lost all their rights,
and they and their holdings were left entirely in the hands of a
large landowner.”</p>

<p>The Enclosure Act, of course, prevented the creation of any
more cottage holdings. The fertility of the soil in these small
holdings, Mr. Swain says, is enormously greater than that of
the land, naturally similar, on the other side of the hedge.
Usually the cottager gets a neighbouring farmer to plough half
an acre of his holding for him, paying for this service in labour
at harvest time; and keeps the rest, except the garden plot,
under grass. The average size of the holding is about six acres;
which is found sufficient for two cows, a heifer, a calf, several
pigs, thirty fowls, and a dozen ducks. The produce supplies
all the vegetables, fruit, milk, butter, eggs and bacon consumed
by the family, and brings in the following money returns, on
Mr. Swain’s calculations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap">As Mr. Swain writes from an intimate personal knowledge,
I have no hesitation in accepting his statement as approximately
accurate.</p>

<p>The injury to the cottagers does not end with the prevention
of the creation of fresh holdings, and the transfer of the ownership
of most of those already existing to the lord of the manor.
For the landlord, managing his estate in the ordinary way,
through the intermediaries of steward and agent, is almost
invariably led into merging such small holdings into larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
farms, in spite of the high rents which would often be gladly
paid.</p>

<p>It will be seen that these two cases are in the nature of
things typical. Similar hardships may be regarded as the
almost inevitable effect of any enclosure which included any
considerable quantity of waste land; and if the enclosure is
necessary or highly desirable, some compensating advantages
ought to be provided for the inhabitants as such. The smallness
of such provision between 1845 and 1875 is very significant.
And it makes one seriously doubt whether in their zeal for
furthering improved culture, the Commissioners were as
considerate as was desirable to the cottager who had a
legal common right. But on that point we can apply no statistical
test.</p>

<p>If we turn from enclosures since 1845 to enclosures before,
we have a verdict from the old Board of Agriculture in its
General Report on Enclosures published in 1808, which, so far
as it is biassed, is biassed entirely in favour of enclosure. It
says: “The benefit (of enclosure) in this case (to the poor) is
by no means unmixed.”</p>

<p>The loss of fuel is declared to be the chief injury; and besides,
“In some cases many cows had been kept without a legal right,
and nothing had been given for the practice.”</p>

<p>“In other cases, where allotments were assigned, the cottagers
could not pay the expense of the measure, and were forced to
sell their allotments.”</p>

<p>“In others they kept cows by right of hiring their cottages,
or common rights, and the land going, of course, to their
proprietor, was added to the farms, and the poor sold their
cows. This is a very common case.”<a name="Anchor_63" id="Anchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a></p>

<p>The results are given of an investigation into the results of
sixty-eight Enclosure Acts, chiefly in the Eastern Counties; testimony
having been obtained from the clergy and others considered
to be impartial witnesses. In fifteen cases it is asserted that
the poor were not injured by the enclosure; in fifty-three cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
that they were. The general tenour of the statement in these
cases is to the effect that the condition of the poor has become
very much worse, that they have lost all their cows,<a name="Anchor_64" id="Anchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> and they
no longer are able to buy milk for their children. Here are a

<p>Alconbury, Huntingdon. (<cite>1791, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 70</cite>.) Several who kept
cows before were, upon enclosure, forced to part with them, and
have kept none since. The cottage allotments going to the
landlords were thrown together, and the inhabitants left without
cows or land. Those who had allotments given in lieu of their
rights, not being able to enclose them,<a name="Anchor_66" id="Anchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a> were forced to sell, and
became as the rest in this respect. Before enclosure milk could
readily be bought, poor people could lay out a half-penny or
a penny every day, but nothing of the sort could be got since.<a name="Anchor_67" id="Anchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a></p>

<p>With regard to Buckingham in general, we have the following
statement from a later survey for the Board of the County:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>“The poor and persons with little capital (such as butchers,
common shepherds, etc.) derive benefit from open fields and
commons, by being enabled to keep horses, cows, and sheep....
It will be difficult to prove that in any case the poor have been
benefited (by enclosure). No instances of benefit on this score
have been stated to me. On the contrary, an increase of poor
(<i>i.e.</i>, of paupers) has been the general complaint.”</p>

<p>Similar evidence is given by two professional Enclosure
Commissioners. Mr. Forster, of Norwich, “lamented that he
had been accessory to injuring 2000 poor people, at the rate of
twenty families per parish. Numbers in the practice of feeding
the commons cannot prove their right; and many, indeed most
who have allotments, have not more than one acre, which being
insufficient for the man’s cow, both the cow and land are usually
sold to opulent farmers. The right sold before the allotment
produced much less than the allotment after it, but the money
is dissipated, doing them no good when they cannot vest it in
stock.”<a name="Anchor_68" id="Anchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Mr. Ewen, another Commissioner, “observed that in most
of the enclosures he has known the poor man’s allotment and
cow are sold five times in six before the award is signed.” A
third Commissioner, Mr. Algar, declared that he made it a
practice to give an allotment whenever a cottager could merely
prove that he had been in the practice of cutting turf. But one
wonders whether Mr. Algar did not find this custom of his
prejudicial to the demand for his professional services.</p>

<p>In estimating the weight of this evidence, both as to
depopulation and as to injury to the poor, it must be borne in
mind that it is taken almost entirely from the mouths of advocates,
and mostly very enthusiastic advocates, of enclosure. They are
admissions of men who feel that the general case in favour of
enclosure is so strong that they may well candidly admit the
existence of some drawbacks. Of course, some advocates of
enclosure are not disposed to make any admissions at all.
Many urge the moral evils engendered by waste lands, as:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>“Where wastes and commons are most extensive, there I have
perceived the Cottagers are the most wretched and worthless;
accustomed to relie on a precarious and vagabond subsistence
from land in a state of nature, when that fails they recur to
pilfering, and thereby become a nuisance to their honest and
industrious neighbours; and if the father of a family of this
sort is withdrawn from society for his crimes, his children
become burthensome to the parish. It may truly be said that
for cottagers of this description the game is preserved, and by
them destroyed; they are mostly beneath the law and out of
reach of detection; and while they can earn four or five shillings,
and sometimes more, in a night, by poaching, they will not be
satisfied with <abbr title="10 pence">10<i>d.</i></abbr> or <abbr title="1 shillings">1<i>s.</i></abbr> a day for honest labour.”<a name="Anchor_69" id="Anchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> A not
unusual style of argument is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To deprive the poor of that benefit, which, in their present
state, they derive from the waste lands, must no doubt, at first
view, sound harsh. But it ought to be remembered that in
this wealthy county, where there is so much work to be done,
and so few hands comparatively to do it, there are few poor that
do not deserve to be so. Those persons who are disqualified to
provide for the calls of human nature by the feebleness of
infancy, the crushing hand of disease, or the infirmities of old
age, cannot be said to be poor, because <em>all</em> the landed property,
situate within their respective parishes, is always liable to be
charged with their maintenance.”<a name="Anchor_70" id="Anchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a></p>

<p>After reading of the good fortune of these Herefordshire
labourers, so much in demand in a wealthy county that the
benefits derived from wastes and commons are of little concern
to them, one naturally inquires, what were their wages? Day
labourers earned in summer, “<abbr title="6 shillings">6<i>s.</i></abbr> a week and a gallon of drink
to each man”;<a name="Anchor_71" id="Anchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> in winter, <abbr title="5 shillings">5<i>s.</i></abbr> a week and three quarts; in
harvest, <abbr title="14 pence">14<i>d.</i></abbr> a day and meat and drink: the hours of labour
being in harvest time and in winter as early and as late as they
could see; in summer, not harvest, from 6 to 6. Leaving out
the cider, this works out at a penny an hour, and a penny in
1794 would not buy very much more of the ultimate necessaries
of life in Herefordshire than it will to-day.</p>

<p>There seems, underlying John Clark’s words, a notion that if
any injury is done to the poor by enclosure, proper and sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
compensation will be made in the ordinary course to the persons
injured out of the poor-rates. The logical deduction is that
the profits of enclosure should contribute to the poor-rates, and
I have noted thirteen enclosures of wastes and commons in
which this was done. Another logical deduction was that the
poor rate in parishes in which waste was enclosed was, in part
at least, a species of common property belonging to the poor;
and to deprive them of this property was robbery, unless the
commons were restored. This view was vigorously expressed by
Cobbett in his “Political Register,” at the time of the introduction
of the Poor Law of 1834, and from him became part of the
traditional stock of political ideas handed down through the
Chartists to the Labour movement of recent times.</p>

<p>Arthur Young, in a pamphlet published in 1801,<a name="Anchor_72" id="Anchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> not only
insists upon the injury to the poor from Enclosure Acts as
ordinarily drawn and put into execution, but pleads for enclosure
on methods which would tend to the social elevation of the
labourer. His proposals, which strike one as, for the time,
wise and statesmanlike, though they ignore some considerations
which would be of great importance to-day, were:</p>

<p>(1) That in the case of small commons in the midst of an
enclosed country, labourers should be allowed to absorb the
whole by gradual encroachments, thus building up small
properties for themselves.</p>

<p>(2) In the case of extensive wastes, procedure must be by
Act of Parliament, but all Acts should secure enough land for
every cottager to keep a cow both summer and winter, such
land to be <em>inalienable from the cottage, and the ownership to be
vested in the parish</em>.</p>

<p>I have found one Act which realises Arthur Young’s ideal of
an Enclosure Act. It was passed in 1824 for Pottern in Wiltshire,
and though it was an Act for the enclosure of a common
only, no commonable meadow or common field being included, I
give its provisions here on account of its intrinsic interest.</p>

<p>The ownership of the whole common was vested in the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of Salisbury, who was lord of the manor, the vicar and churchwardens,
in trust for the parish. The trustees were required to
lease it in small holdings, with or without rent, to poor, honest,
and industrious persons, who had not, except in cases of accident
or illness, availed themselves of Poor Law relief.</p>

<p>The following Acts, all (except that for Earsham) for “extinguishing
village communities,” <i>i.e.</i>, for enclosing all the commonable
lands of the parishes or townships, which in each case
include commonable arable fields, have special provisions to
safeguard the interests of the poor:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>1757, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 53</cite>. Wimeswould, Leicestershire. Cottagers who
have no land are to have a share together within one fence,
which they may afterwards separately enclose if they like. This
is specially interesting as anticipating the modern practice of
providing allotments for such cottagers.</p>

<p><cite>1767, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 49</cite>. Carlton in Lindrick, Nottingham. Three acres
(out of a total of 2492 acres) are to be set aside for building
cottages for the benefit of the poor.</p>

to the value of <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr> per annum (out of <abbr title="1200 pounds">£1200</abbr>) are to be set

free of taxes, for fuel for the poor.</p>

area is to be vested in the lord of the manor, vicar, and overseers,
in trust for the poor, for common of pasture and fuel.</p>

aside for the benefit of the poor, partly to be used as common
for fuel, or to be leased to pay for fuel; another part to provide
a common pasture for the poor inhabitants; while the <em>remainder</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
(how much? one wonders) was to be leased in aid of the
poor-rates.</p>

<p><cite>1812, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 17</cite>. Earsham, Norfolk. Five acres to be set aside

Wilbraham, Cambridge (<cite>1797, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 89</cite>), and Barnady, Suffolk,
allotments were made inalienable from the cottages for which
they were assigned. At Northwold land capable of supplying
annually 12,000 turves per annum was reserved as a common
turbary for the poorer owners of common rights.<a name="Anchor_73" id="Anchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73" href="#Anchor_73" title="Return to text.">[73]</a> I must here refer to the extraordinary Act by which Pickering Moor (Yorkshire,
West Riding) was enclosed in 1785 and divided equally among all owners
of common rights, the poorest cottager owning an ancient cottage getting as
much as the largest landowner. Before enclosure the yeomen of Pickering had
pastured such animals on the moor as they could provide with winter keep.
The great tithes were rented by an enterprising lessee, who conceived the idea
of parcelling the moor into small farms which would grow corn and yield tithes.
In spite of the disinclination of the yeomen to any change, he procured the
passing of an Enclosure Act, in which it was declared that the moor was equally
the property of all ancient cottages and messuages, and was required to be
divided equally among the owners of all of these. A peculiar clause in the Act
enacted that no part of the moor should be “deemed barren in respect of tithes.”
The larger yeomen felt themselves to be cheated, and were very indignant, but
through inertness and lack of co-operation they failed to take steps to prevent
the Act being executed. This they presumably might have done by an appeal
to Quarter Sessions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>This list of Acts containing special provisions for the benefit
of the poor is not a complete one, but if it were it would not, I
believe, include more than one per cent. of the Enclosure Acts
passed prior to 1845. Arthur Young did not over-state the case
when he wrote: “By nineteen Enclosure Acts out of twenty,
the poor are injured, in some grossly injured.... The poor in
these parishes may say, and with truth, <em>Parliament may be
tender of property, all I know is, I had a cow, and an Act of
Parliament has taken it from me</em>.”<a name="Anchor_74" id="Anchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a></p>

<p>That the poor were not always the only sufferers from an
Enclosure Act, is shown by the account given by the General
Report on Enclosures of the way in which farmers were affected.
After referring to the idea that opposition from farmers
is usually to be ascribed to ignorant prejudice, the report
proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>“In many instances they have suffered considerably for four,
five, or six years. From the first starting the project of an
Enclosure Act to the final award, has, in numerous cases, taken
two, three, four, and even five or six years; their management
is deranged; not knowing where their future lands will be
allotted, they save all their dung till much of it is good for
little; they perform all the operations of tillage with inferior
attention; perhaps the fields are cross-cropped and exhausted,
and not well recovered under a course of years. Rents are
greatly raised and too soon; so that if they do not absolutely
lose five years they at least suffer a great check. In point of
profit, comparing the old with the new system, attention must
be paid to their capitals; open field land is managed (notwithstanding
the inconvenience of its pieces) usually with a less
capital than enclosures; and though the <em>general</em> profit of the
latter exceeds that of the former, yet this will entirely depend
on the capital being adequate. In cases where the new enclosures
are laid down to grass, all this becomes of tenfold force;
to stock rich grass lands demands a far greater sum than open
field arable; the farmer may not possess it; this has often
happened, and drove them to seek other investments, giving
way to new-comers more able to undertake the new system
introduced; and if profit be measured by a percentage on the
capital employed, the old system might, at the old rents, exceed
the profits of the new; and this is certainly the farmers’ view
of the comparison. He also who had given the attention of a
life to the regular routine of open field arable, without 10 acres
of grass ever having been in his occupation, may find himself
much at a loss in the regular purchase and sale of live stock,
the profit of which depends so much on habitual skill. Add to
all this the previous circumstance of laying down to grass, the
business of all others of which farmers know the least, of which
I have many times seen in new enclosures striking instances;
and if all these points be duly considered, we shall not find
much reason to be surprised at the repugnance shown by many
farmers to the idea of enclosing.” (<cite><abbr title="Pages">Pp.</abbr> 31, 32</cite>.)</p>

<p>While the whole of this description of the ordeal that the
farmers had to pass through is interesting, the point I desire
here to emphasize is the need of a larger capital after enclosure.
Those who had the requisite skill, knowledge, energy and
capital survived the crisis; they were able to take up the farms
which their weaker neighbours were compelled to relinquish;
to send, in almost every case, a larger <em>surplus</em> of food from the
lands of the parish to maintain the state and power of England,
and to pay higher rents. In perhaps the majority of cases they
raised a larger gross produce, and provided maintenance and
employment for a larger population than before. In some cases
even (though these were rare exceptions) the labouring population
gained in material prosperity as well as in numbers. But
in any case the relationship between employer and employed
was notably altered.</p>

<p>In the open field village the entirely landless labourer was
scarcely to be found. The division of holdings into numerous
scattered pieces, many of which were of minute size, made it
easy for a labourer to obtain what were in effect allotments in
the common fields. If he had no holding, he still might have a
common right; if no acknowledged common right, he might
enjoy the advantage of one in a greater or less degree. From
the poorest labourer to the richest farmer, there was, in the
typical open field village, a gradation of rank. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
perceptible social gap between the cottager who worked the
greater part of his time for others, and for the smaller part of
his time on his own holding, who is therefore properly termed a
labourer, and his neighbour who reversed that distribution of
time, and is therefore to be deemed a farmer. It was easy
for the efficient or fortunate man to rise on such a social
ladder; equally easy for the inefficient or unlucky to slip
downwards.</p>

<p>After enclosure the comparatively few surviving farmers,
enriched, elevated intellectually as well as socially by the
successful struggle with a new environment, faced, across a deep
social gulf, the labourers who had now only their labour to
depend upon. In the early part of the nineteenth century, at
any rate, it was almost impossible for a labourer to cross that
gulf; on his side the farmer henceforward, instead of easily
becoming a farm labourer if bankrupt, would rather try his
fortune in the growing industrial towns.</p>

<p>Our “Country Farmer” gives us a vivid picture of one side
of the social change (<cite>“Thoughts on Enclosure,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 21</cite>). Of
the farmer after enclosure he says:</p>

<p>“Their entertainments are as expensive as they are elegant,
for it is no uncommon thing for one of these new created
farmers to spend ten or twelve pounds at one entertainment;
and to wash down delicate food, must have the most expensive
wines, and these the best of their kind; and to set off the
entertainment in the greatest splendour, an elegant sideboard of
plate is provided in the newest fashion. As to dress no one
that was not personally acquainted with the opulent farmer’s
daughter can distinguish her from the daughter of a Duke by
her dress, both equally wishing to imitate something, but they
know not what.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>“View the farmer before the land was inclosed, and you will
find him entertaining his friends with a part of a hog of his
own feeding, and a draught of ale brewed from his own malt
presented in a brown jug, or a glass, if it would bear it, which
was the utmost of his extravagance: in those happy days you
might view the farmer in a coat of the growth of his flock; and
spun by his industrious wife and daughters, and his stockings
produced from the same quarter of his industry, and his wife
and daughters clad from their own hands of industry and their
own flock.”</p>

<p>As for the other side of this social change, the labourer’s
side, it seemed so serious an evil to many even of the progressive
landlords and agriculturists who strongly advocated
enclosure, that they busied themselves to find a remedy.</p>

<p>In 1897 the Board of Agriculture drew the attention of its
members to a typical case. Mr. Thomas Bernard communicated
an “Account of a Cottage and Garden near Tadcaster.”
The cottager had held two acres of land and a common right at
Poppleton for nine years, and there had lived comfortably and
brought up six children. The enclosure of the parish turned
him adrift, but he prevailed upon a landlord to let him have a
piece of roadside waste for a garden, saying, “I will show you
the <em>fashions</em> on it.” The landlord was so delighted afterwards
with the way in which this garden was cultivated, that he
offered the man to let him have it rent free. Particular attention
was directed to the man’s reply:&mdash;“Now, sir, you have a
pleasure in seeing my cottage and garden neat: and why should
not other squires have the same pleasure in seeing the cottages
and gardens nice about them? The poor would then be happy
and would love them and the place where they lived; but now
every nook of land is let to the great farmers; and nothing left
for the poor but to go to the parish.” (<cite>“Communications to the
Board,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 404</cite>.)</p>

<p>It was by “going to the parish” that the labourer could bring
home to the landlord the idea that the spirit of ambition and self-reliance
fostered by the possession of two acres and a common
right was of value to the nation. The national emergency due
to the famine prices of food during the French War, which produced
the complete change in the spirit of the administration of
the Poor Law associated with the “Speenhamland Act of
Parliament,” also forced into public attention the desirability of
both providing agricultural labourers with some other supplement
to their wages, and of encouraging them to avoid pauperism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
We accordingly find the Board of Agriculture offering for 1800
three gold medals:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To the person who shall build on his estate the most cottages
for labouring families, and assign to each a proper portion of land,
for the support of not less than a cow, a hog, and a sufficient
garden&mdash;the Gold Medal.”</p>

<p>“To the person who shall produce the most satisfactory
account of the best means of supporting cows on poor land in a
method applicable to cottagers&mdash;the Gold Medal,” (doubts having
been raised with regard to the practicability of cottagers keeping
cows except on rich soil).</p>

<p>“The Board having received information that the labouring
poor of Rutland and Lincolnshire, having land for one or two
cows, and a sufficiency of potatoes, have not applied, in the present
scarcity, for any poor law relief; and it appearing to be a great
national object to spread so beneficial a system, the Board will
give to the person who shall explain, in the most satisfactory
manner, the best means for rendering this practice as general
through the kingdom as circumstances will admit&mdash;the Gold
Medal.” (<cite>“Communications,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr></cite>)</p>

<p>Each of these medals was again offered in subsequent years.</p>

<p>The question appears to have been first brought before the
Board of Agriculture by the Earl of Winchilsea, in a conversation
at the Farmers’ Club with Sir John Sinclair, President of the
Board, in 1795. At Sir John Sinclair’s request, the Earl of
Winchilsea put his views in writing, and they were submitted to
the Board, in the form of a letter, dated Jan. 4th, 1796. This
letter is a convincing statement in favour of the case for “three
acres and a cow,” and deserves the attention of politicians of
to-day.</p>

<p>Beginning by stating that he has made further enquiries,
since the conversation with Sir John Sinclair, into the practice
of agricultural labourers keeping cows, he continues:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>“I am
more and more confirmed in the opinion I have long had, that
nothing is so beneficial, both to them and to the landowners, as
their having land to be occupied either for the keeping of cows,
or as gardens, according to circumstances. By means of these
advantages, the labourers and their families live better, and are
consequently more fit to endure labour; and it makes them
more contented, and gives them a sort of independence, which
makes them set a higher value on their character.... When
a labourer has obtained a cow, and land sufficient to maintain
her, the first thing he has thought of has been how he could
save money enough to buy another; ... there are from 70 to
80 labourers upon my estate in Rutland, who keep from 1 to 4
cows each.... I am informed that those who manage well
clear about <abbr title="20 pence">20<i>d.</i></abbr> per week, or <abbr title="4 pounds 6 shillings and 8 pence">£4 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr> per <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr> by each
cow.”<a name="Anchor_75" id="Anchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_75" id="Footnote_75" href="#Anchor_75" title="Return to text.">[75]</a> Milk being valued at <abbr title="1 penny">1<i>d.</i></abbr> per quart; it seems clear also that what is consumed
at home is not included in this calculation.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>If the cow died, it was, he says, a great misfortune for the
labourer, but he contrived to beg or borrow the money necessary
to obtain another cow&mdash;“I scarcely ever knew a cow-gait given
up for want of ability to obtain a cow, except in the case of old
and infirm women.”</p>

<p>He classifies the situation of labourers, in order of felicity, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p id="felicity_1">(1) Those who have a sufficient quantity of grass enclosed land
to enable them to keep one or more cows winter and summer,
and a garden near their house; a grass field allotted to a certain
number being as advantageous, or nearly so, as separate small
enclosures.</p>

<p id="felicity_2">(2) Those who have a summer pasture for their cow, and some
arable land, on which they grow the winter provision. This is
slightly less advantageous than (<a href="#felicity_1" title="Go to point 1.">1</a>), because tilling the arable
land takes up more time.</p>

<p>(3) Those who have a right of common for the summer keep of
the cow, and a meadow, or arable ground, or the share of a
meadow in common, for the winter provision. If it were not
that commons are usually over-stocked, this would be equivalent
to (<a href="#felicity_1" title="Go to point 1.">1</a>) or (<a href="#felicity_2" title="Go to point 2.">2</a>).</p>

<p>(4) Those who have a right of common, but no cow, and a
garden. In this case geese and pigs can be kept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>(5) Those who have a right of common and no garden. In
this case the value of the right of common depends upon
whether fuel is obtained from the common or not.</p>

<p>(6) Those who have several acres of arable land, and no summer
pasture for a cow. This, he maintains, is of little value,
because of the large expenditure of labour necessary for cultivating
the land, but he admits that many would differ from him on
this point.</p>

<p>(7) Those who have a garden near the house.</p>

<p>(8) Those who have no land whatever. “This is a very bad
situation for a labourer to be placed in, both for his comfort and
the education of his children.”</p>

<p>Then he continues, in words which seem in general as true
and weighty now as when written or as at any time within the last
hundred years:&mdash;“In countries where it has never been the
custom for labourers to keep cows, it would be very difficult to
introduce it; but where no gardens have been annexed to the
cottages it is sufficient to give the ground, and the labourer is
sure to know what to do with it, and will reap an immediate
benefit from it ... there should be as much as will produce
all the garden stuff the family consumes, and enough, with the
addition of a little meal, for a pig. I think they ought to pay
the same rent that a farmer would pay for the land, and no more.
I am persuaded that it frequently happens that a labourer lives
in a house at <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> a year rent, which he is unable to pay, to
which, if a garden of a rood was added, for which he would
have to pay five or ten shillings a year more, that he would be
enabled, by the profit he would derive from the garden, to pay
the rent of the house, etc., with great advantage to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>“As I before mentioned, some difficulties may occur in
establishing the custom of labourers keeping cows in those parts
of the country where no such custom has existed; wherever it
has or does exist it ought by all means to be encouraged, and
not suffered to fall into disuse, as has been the case to a great
degree in the midland counties, one of the causes of which I
apprehend to be, the dislike the generality of farmers have to
seeing the labourers rent any land. Perhaps one of their reasons
for disliking this is, that the land, if not occupied by the labourers,
would fall to their share; and another, I am afraid, is, that they
rather wish to have the labourers more dependent upon them,
for which reasons they are always desirous of hiring the house
and land occupied by a labourer, under pretence, that by that
means the landlord will be secure of his rent, and that they will
keep the house in repair. This the agents of estates are too apt
to give in to, as they find it much less trouble to meet six than
sixty tenants at a rent day, and by this means avoid the being
sometimes obliged to hear the wants and complaints of the
poor.” ... The landlord naturally yields to this pressure
... “and it is in this manner that the labourers have been
dispossessed of their cow-pastures in various parts of the
midland counties. The moment the farmer obtains his wish,
he takes every particle of the land to himself, and relets the
house to the labourer, who by this means is rendered miserable,
the poors rate increased, the value of the estate to the landlord
diminished, and the house suffered to go to decay....
Whoever travels through the midland counties, and will take the
trouble of enquiring, will generally receive the answer, that
formerly there were a great many cottagers who kept cows, but
that the land is now thrown to the farmers; and if he enquires
still further, he will find that in those parishes the poors rates
have increased in an amazing degree, more than according to
the average rise throughout England.”</p>

<p>Sir John Sinclair,<a name="Anchor_76" id="Anchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> President of the Board of Agriculture, did
not agree that a plot of a few acres of arable land was, by itself,
of little value to the agricultural labourer. He estimates that
two cows can be kept on 3¼ acres of arable land, and that the net
produce, valuing milk at <abbr title="1 penny">1<i>d.</i></abbr> per quart, would amount to <abbr title="21 pounds">£21</abbr>
per annum, about as much as the man’s wages. He advocated
spade labour, and recommended that the cottager should rather
hire men to dig for him, than get the land ploughed. In confirmation
of this opinion Sir Henry Vavasour cited an example
of a cottager holding 3 acres who kept two cows and two pigs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
butter alone paid the rent, and the gross produce was estimated
at <abbr title="54 pounds">£54</abbr> per annum, exclusive of milk and vegetables consumed
at home.</p>

<p>It is of course practically impossible to calculate how much
effect this landowners’ agitation for the policy of “Three acres
and a cow” had on the number of such cottage holdings. Lord
Brownlow<a name="Anchor_77" id="Anchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> writes: “In all open field lordships there have always
been pastures in which the cottagers have had their share of
benefit; but the practice of enabling cottagers to keep cows in
inclosed parishes, is in my neighbourhood rare, and of recent
date.” Accounts are sent of cottage holdings provided by the
Earl of Carrington, and of large allotments provided by Mr.
Thomas Estcourt; but I cannot say how extensively their
example was followed.</p>

<p><cite>Mr. W. E. Bear’s report to the recent Labour Commission</cite>, on
the agricultural labourers of the Southwell Union, contains the
following passage, in which we probably see some fruits of the
Earl of Winchilsea’s movement:&mdash;“Small holdings, of three to
ten acres commonly, are let with cottages in a few parishes, and
called ‘cottagers.’  This custom appears to be a very old one,
dating back far beyond the time when the term ‘three acres
and a cow’  was invented. In Ossington, Mr. Richardson told
me, it was 50 years old or more; but he said it was falling into
disuse. I found some ‘cottagers’  in Averham, Ossington and
Hockerton, and heard of them in another parish or two. They
usually consist of grass land, and are best so, as the labourer can
leave his wife to manage the cow or two kept on them, and work
for wages regularly. In Averham some of these small holdings
have been given up, apparently because they were partly arable,
and occupiers found that they could not keep regular places and
also attend to their land. But where the land is all pasture,
they are excellent institutions, providing families with milk, and
adding to the incomes by means of milk or butter, poultry, eggs
and pork sold. These little holdings are let from <abbr title="2 pounds 10 shillings">£2 10<i>s.</i></abbr> to
<abbr title="3 pounds">£3</abbr> an acre, including the cottage” (<cite><abbr title="paragraph">par.</abbr> 51 A</cite>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>The same Commissioner found in Leicestershire a system of
common cow-runs for cottagers which also probably dates from
the eighteenth century, being in some way a survival from the
common field system. He describes it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There are cow plots let with cottages in several parishes.
Some have already been referred to as existing on the Earl of
Dysart’s estate. One example is to be found at Saxby, where
cow runs of 6 <abbr title="acres">a.</abbr> 3 <abbr title="roods">r.</abbr> 12 <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>, each in common, are let with a cottage
and garden at <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr> per annum. At Grimston I visited some
which are let by Mr. Wright or Mr. Reckitts, who appear to be
somehow connected on the same estate.... Some of these
cow-plots are 3½ acres in extent, and their holders are allowed to
keep only one cow, as three or more of them occupy a pasture in
common, having a portion of their 3½ acres each year to mow and
another portion to feed. The rent, including cottage and garden,
is <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr>. There are some other cow plots of 8 acres on which two
or three cows are kept, the rent being <abbr title="15 pounds">£15</abbr>. In these cases, too,
the pasture is common to several holders, each one having a
piece to mow, while they run their cows together on the portion
devoted to grazing. As an example of the advantage which a
cow plot may sometimes be to a labourer and his family, I may
mention the case of a widow who has 3½ acres and a very good
cottage for <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr> per annum. Last year she had an exceptionally
good cow, and she sold milk at the rate of <abbr title="6 pence">6<i>d.</i></abbr> a gallon, amounting
to <abbr title="15 pounds 10 shillings">£15 10<i>s.</i></abbr>, fattening a calf which sold at <abbr title="4 pounds 10 shillings">£4 10<i>s.</i></abbr>; altogether
the return was <abbr title="20 pounds">£20</abbr>, besides what milk was consumed in the
cottage.”</p>

<p>Another probable survival of the Earl of Winchilsea’s movement
is thus described by Mr. Rider Haggard:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The system of cottage holdings was introduced about a
hundred years ago on the Burley estate” (Rutlandshire) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>“and
was copied by the late Lord Tollemache, who was brother-in-law
of the late Mr. Finch. It is in force in the parishes of Burley,
Egleton, Hambleton and Greetham. In 1901 there lived in
those parishes forty-three small occupiers, whose acreage varied
from 5 acres to 40 acres, the holdings being all grass. Originally
there were many more, the Hambleton cow pasture, which is 102
acres in estate, being divided into 80 cow commons. Some of
the holders occupy two or more small fields, but the general
custom has been for tenants to graze large fields in common,
and to have separate small fields reserved for mowing hay in the
winter. In the fields which are grazed in common, five roods have
been taken as sufficient to keep a cow.” (<cite>“Rural England,”

<p>In this table the cross-heading A includes Acts up to and
including the year 1801, in which year a general Act facilitating
enclosure was passed; cross-heading B, Acts from 1802–1845;
cross-heading C, enclosures under the General Enclosure Act of
1845 and subsequent amending Acts. No Act or enclosure is
included unless the enclosure was partly of arable common field,
but in some few cases, as will be seen from the <a href="#appendix_b" title="Go to Appendix B.">Appendix</a> giving
the chief particulars of each Act, the arable land formed only a
trifling part of the area dealt with.</p>

<p>Where the area enclosed is not stated, and cannot even be
approximately inferred from the wording of the Act, it is estimated
on the assumption that the average area per Act where the area
is not stated, is the same as for Acts relating to the same county
where the area affected is stated, enclosures under the Act of 1845
being left out of account. This method, I believe, gives more
satisfactory results than any other would; but it must be confessed
that in the case of Norfolk the Acts in which the area is not stated
are so many, and those in which it is stated are so few, that
the average obtained is not trustworthy. In this case I believe
the figure arrived at is too large. The counties are arranged in
order of prevalence of Parliamentary enclosures.</p>

<span class="sub_head">ENCLOSURE OF COMMON FIELDS WITHOUT PARLIAMENTARY
SANCTION.</span></h2>

<p>On the <a href="#enclosure" title="Go to the Enclosure Map of England.">map</a> of England, in <a href="#chapter_7" title="Chapter 7">Chapter VII.</a>, enclosures of common
field parishes by Act of Parliament before the General Enclosure
Act of 1801 are shaded vertically, such enclosures from 1802 to
1845 are dotted, and subsequent enclosures under the General
Enclosure Act of 1845 are black. In other words, all the shaded
area represents the area of parishes which had arable common
fields up to the year 1700, all the dotted and black area represents
the area of parishes which had arable common fields up to 1801,
and all the black area represents the area of parishes which had
arable common fields up to 1845.</p>

<p>What about the area which is not shaded at all?</p>

<p>An inspection of the map yields certain striking results.</p>

<p>In the first place, we see that the shaded districts lie in a broad
band across England from north-east to south-west, from the
East Riding of Yorkshire to Dorset and the east part of Somerset.</p>

<p>Secondly, we see that there is a perfectly sharp line of
demarcation between the shaded and the non-shaded area,
running through Suffolk, Essex, passing through London, and
along the border between Surrey and Kent. This line becomes
indefinite as it passes through the Weald of Surrey and Sussex, but
its termination can be traced in the part of Sussex which lies on the
southern slope of the South Downs. In the white area to the
south-east of this line there are but two shaded patches&mdash;the
parishes of Iken and Orford, in Suffolk, situated close together,
in the peninsula formed by the estuaries of the rivers Alde
and Deben.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we can trace an equally sharp line of demarcation
between the shaded and the non-shaded area in the south-west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
running from the Bristol to the English Channel, across Somerset
and Dorset. South-west of this line there is no shaded patch&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
there is no case of common field enclosed by Act of
Parliament.</p>

<p>Fourthly, on the north-west side of the shaded belt, towards
Wales and Scotland, there is no sharp line of demarcation between
the shaded and the non-shaded area, but as one travels further
and further from the central axis of the shaded area to the
north-west, the shaded patches become sparser and sparser;
but still some shaded patches are to be found in every English
county on this side of the shaded belt, except Lancashire.</p>

<p>Fifthly, it is to be noticed that along the central axis of the
shaded belt the vertical shading&mdash;indicating enclosure by Act of
Parliament in the eighteenth century&mdash;greatly predominates,
and most of all the shading is overwhelmingly vertical in the
very centre of the shaded area. Dotted and black patches,
indicating Parliamentary enclosure in the nineteenth century,
and particularly black, indicating the latest group of Parliamentary
enclosures, show more prominently in the edges or
fringes of the coloured area. In other words, when the great
movement of Parliamentary Enclosure began in the eighteenth
century, its chief field was the very centre of the district over
which it ultimately spread.</p>

<p>It is obvious that there must be certain broad historical
reasons for these striking facts. The map, in fact, presents to
us a series of definite puzzles for solution.</p>

<p>1. How and when was the south-eastern corner of England
enclosed?</p>

<p>2. How and when was the south-western corner enclosed?</p>

<p>3. How and when was the great district in the north-west,
in which Parliamentary enclosure is the exception, enclosed?</p>

<p>4. How and when were the numerous parishes within what
we may call the Parliamentary Enclosure belt, which escaped
Parliamentary enclosure, enclosed?</p>

<p>And lastly, there is the question which sums these up, and
presents the problem on the other side&mdash;</p>

<p>5. Why were special Acts of Parliament necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
enclosure of some three thousand of the English parishes, in
the geographical position indicated by the map?</p>

<p>And it is important that it should be clearly understood that
this is the more natural way of putting the question, because
the surprising fact is not that the common field system should
gradually and quietly disappear in parish A, but that it should
persist in parish B, until ended by the very expensive and
troublesome measure of a special Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>In order to proceed as far as possible from the known to the
unknown, we will first consider the various methods of common
field enclosure operating within the belt of Parliamentary
Enclosure of common fields. But before beginning this enquiry,
attention may be drawn to a ray of light which the map throws
upon the social history of England in the Tudor period. The
reader of the history of that period is tempted to suppose that
the districts from which the greatest complaints, and still more
riots and insurrections, arose against enclosures, were those in
which enclosure was proceeding most rapidly. Now, the most
formidable of these popular agitations began in the reign of
Edward <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> in Somersetshire, and spread northwards and eastwards,
growing in intensity, till it reached its climax in Ket’s
rebellion in Norfolk.<a name="Anchor_78" id="Anchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> The earlier complaints also come from
counties within the Parliamentary Enclosure belt&mdash;Oxford,
Buckingham, Wiltshire and others. The map suggests that a
possible interpretation of these popular movements is, that an
industrial and economic change involving normally the enclosure
of common fields was in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
gradually spreading over the southern and midland counties;
that in some parts it met with little or no resistance; but that
in other parts popular resistance was roused to some features
of this change, including the enclosure of arable fields, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
that popular resistance was in a very great degree successful in
causing the postponement of such enclosure. Briefly, a special
outcry against enclosure in a particular locality shows, not
necessarily that enclosure was proceeding with special rapidity
there, but possibly that there it was specially obnoxious; and
being there specially obnoxious, proceeded more slowly than
elsewhere.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Enclosure by Principal Landlord.</h3>

<p>But to return to our own subject. We have shown that
enclosure by Act of Parliament was greatly to the landlord’s
interest; but it is perfectly obvious that the landlord’s interest
was much more served by an enclosure without all the expense,
loss of time, labour and anxiety involved in Parliamentary proceedings.
Obviously, therefore, if one landlord could acquire all
the open and commonable land in the parish, he would enclose
without an Act of Parliament. The only difficulty in his way
would be in arranging leases so that they should all fall in
simultaneously, or, failing this, in overcoming the resistance
of any tenant whose lease gave him the power of resisting, if he
were unwilling to agree. We have noticed that even in recent
years the common fields of Yelden in Bedfordshire have disappeared
in this way; that the Duchy of Cornwall in 1876
bought out all the copyholders holding lands in Fordington
Field; that Earl Manvers is similarly acquiring by degrees all
the common rights in the common fields of Laxton, and the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners are endeavouring in this way to
procure the enclosure of Elmstone Hardwicke; that Stratton
and Grimstone were thus enclosed since 1900, and that the
common fields of several Berkshire parishes have thus disappeared
within the last half-century. The same process can
be watched on a much larger scale with regard to common
rights over commons proper. The buying up of the rights of
commoners over Dartmoor by the Duchy of Cornwall is one
striking example; similar purchases of common rights over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Wiltshire downs on a very large scale have come into notice
through the approach to Stonehenge being affected.</p>

<p>The enclosure of common fields in this way is proceeding
slowly merely because the remains of common fields are now so
small.</p>

<p>And it is obvious that through the last two hundred years
the restraints of law and public opinion upon the freedom of
the country squire or great landowner, in doing as he likes with
the villages under his control, have been gradually and continuously
strengthened. In looking back over the nineteenth and
eighteenth centuries, we are looking back at a greater and greater
proportion of local autocratic power accompanying any given
degree of local pre-eminence in wealth and landed property.</p>

<p>If we look back to the beginning of the eighteenth century we
find the principles generally accepted by the landowning class
with regard to the general management of their estates, and
particularly with regard to common fields, thus clearly laid
down by Edward Lawrence in “<cite>The duty of a Steward to his
Lord</cite>”:&mdash;</p>

<p>Article <abbr title="14">XIV.</abbr> “A Steward should not forget to make the
best Enquiry into the Disposition of any of the Freeholders
within or near any of his Lord’s Manors to sell their Lands, that
he may use his best Endeavours to purchase them at as reasonable
a price as may be for his lord’s Advantage and Convenience
... especially in such Manors where Improvements are to be
made by inclosing Commons and Common fields.... If the
Freeholders cannot <em>all</em> be persuaded to sell yet at least an
Agreement for Inclosing should be pushed forward by the
Steward” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9</cite>).</p>

<p>“The Steward should not suffer any of the Lord’s lands
to be let to Freehold Tenants within or near his Lord’s
Manor” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34</cite>).</p>

<p>“The Steward should endeavour to lay all the small Farms,
let to poor indigent People, to the great ones” ... but “It
is unwise to unite farms all at once, because of the odium and
increase of Poor-rates. It is much more reasonable and
popular to stay till such farms fall into Hand by Death” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35</cite>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>And to facilitate this process, “Noblemen and Gentlemen
should endeavour to convert copyhold for lives to Leasehold
for lives” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 60</cite>).</p>

<p>The significance of this last recommendation may be illustrated
by the passage in William Marshall’s account, in “<cite>Agriculture
of Gloucestershire</cite>,” published about sixty years afterwards,
of the Cotswold Hills:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thirty years ago this district lay almost entirely in an open
state; namely in arable common field, sheep-walk, and cowdown.
At present it may be said to be in a state of inclosure, though
some few townships yet remain open.</p>

<p>“The difficulties of Inclosure were not, in this case, numerous
or great. The sheep-walks and cowdowns were all of them
stinted by ‘yardlands’  in the arable fields: there was not,
perhaps, one unstinted common on these hills. They were,
formerly, many of them, or all of them, occupied by leasehold
tenants for three lives renewable. A species of tenancy I have
not met before. Many of these leaseholds had fallen in. The
removal of those which remained, was” (<i>sic</i>: he means, of
course, “removed”) “the main obstacle of inclosure.”</p>

<p>Because the number of Acts for Enclosure gradually increases
through the eighteenth century, and reaches its maximum at
the opening of the nineteenth century, it has been hastily
assumed by some that the process of enclosure was similarly
accelerated. But it is on <i>a priori</i> grounds at least as probable
that there was no acceleration in the rate of extinction of common
fields, only a gradual change in the prevailing method of
procedure.</p>

<p>Thus very few Acts of Enclosure are extant previous to 1727,
the year in which Edward Lawrence recommends to Stewards
and Landlords a vigorous enclosure campaign. That that
campaign was being carried on at the time can be shown by two
contemporary extracts from writers on opposite sides. The
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Laurence of Yelvertoft, in the <cite>“New System of
Agriculture,” 1726</cite>, writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>“The great quantities of ground that have been of late and
are daily inclosing, and the increase of Rent that is everywhere
made by those who do inclose, sufficiently demonstrate the
benefit and use of Inclosures. In the Bishopric of Durham
nine parts in ten are already inclosed”<a name="Anchor_79" id="Anchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45</cite>).</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_79" id="Footnote_79" href="#Anchor_79" title="Return to text.">[79]</a> This statement is confirmed by the Board of Agriculture reporter: “In this
county the lands, or common fields of townships, were for the most part inclosed
soon after the Restoration.” (<cite>Joseph Granger, “Agriculture of Durham,” 1794</cite>.)
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>John Cowper, in “<cite>Inclosing Commons and Common fields is
contrary to the interest of the Nation</cite>” says:&mdash;“I myself within
these 30 years past” (<i>i.e.</i>, 1702–1732), “have seen above twenty
Lordships or Parishes inclosed ... I have been informed by
an eminent Surveyor that one third of all the land of England
has been inclosed within these 80 years.”</p>

<p>Perhaps what the eminent Surveyor said to John Cowper is
not very convincing evidence. But in considering the estimate
of the amount of enclosure in the “last 80 years,” <i>i.e.</i>, from
1652, the first year of peace after the Civil War, to 1732, the
time when John Cowper wrote, we have to bear in mind, firstly,
that there was an important enclosure movement going on in
the Commonwealth period; and secondly, that in 1660, with the
Restoration, the country gentry came by their own again. The
King’s ministers during the reigns of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>,
William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> and Anne would scarcely have dared, even if they
had desired, to check any proceedings on the part of landowners,
with the object of raising rents. The whole policy of Parliament
was, in fact, in sympathy with this object, as may be seen from
all the legislature affecting agriculture.</p>

<p>For the first part of this period there is further evidence of
the progress of enclosure in John Houghton’s “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Collection for
the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade</cite>.” In repeated issues
he strongly advocates Enclosure; in that for September 8, 1681,
he says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Oh that I had sufficient influence to put it</span>” (<i>i.e.</i>, a
General Enclosure Act) “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">to the trial, if it did not succeed I’d be
content not to be drunk this seven years</span>” ... “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Witness
the many enclosures that have of late been made, and that
people are daily on gog on making</span>” (<cite><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 15, 16</cite>). It will be
remembered that a General Enclosure Act for Scotland was
passed in 1695.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up, it is clear that the Parliamentary enclosure of a
given parish indicates that the lord of the manor, or principal
landlord, had not secured such a complete or preponderating
influence over the parish as to enable him to effect an enclosure
without an Act of Parliament.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Enclosure by Yeomen.</h3>

<p>And yet, on the other hand, it does not appear that the
absence of any lord of the manor, or of any single landowner
superior in wealth to the others in the parish was favourable,
through the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
to the continuance of common fields, except where many of the
properties were extremely small.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in
Elmstone Hardwicke, while desiring themselves to enclose the
parish, discourage enclosure by the tenants on their own account,
by raising the rents to a prohibitive extent. Similarly Edward
Lawrence in 1727, while urging, as we have seen, the steward
to procure a general enclosure of his lord’s manor, declares that
it is the duty of the steward, particularly if his lord is the owner
of the Great Tithe, to prevent gradual enclosure by yeomen&mdash;“He
should be ever on his watch to prevent (if possible) the
Freeholders inclosing any part of their land in the common
fields (<cite>Article <abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr> </cite>).” “Partial enclosure should never be
permitted without a general agreement to do the whole.”</p>

<p>The objection of the Tithe Owner to enclosures in the common
fields was that by increasing the pasture, and decreasing the
arable area, they diminished the produce of grain and so
diminished the tithe. John Houghton (September 16, 1681,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16) also refers to the objection of the tithe owning clergy to
enclosure. And this objection was probably one of the strongest
forces against enclosure at that time.</p>

<p>Again, going back a century and a quarter, John Norden’s
“<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Book of Surveying</cite>,” published about 1600, in one place
recommends general enclosure, on the ground that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">one acre
enclosed is woorth one and a half in Common, if the ground be
fitting thereto</span>” (<cite><a id="surveying_book_3">Book <abbr title="3">III.</abbr></a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 97</cite>), in another declares “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Also
enclosures of common fields, or meddowes in part, by such as
are most powerful and mighty, without the Lord’s licence, and
the Tenants’ assents, is more than may be permitted</span>”
(<cite><i><a href="#surveying_book_3" title="Go to previous citation.">ibid.</a></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 96</cite>).</p>

<p>The reason of course is, firstly, that the holder of lands in
common fields or common meadows, who fenced his holding, or
parts of it, thereby prevented the other holders from exercising
their rights of pasturing their cattle upon the fenced portions,
without giving up his recognised right to pasture cattle on his
neighbours’ holdings, very likely indeed turning out all the more
cattle in the summer and autumn, because better supplied with
winter feed; and, secondly, because the shade of his hedges, if
he set quickset hedges, injured his neighbours’ crops. In
“Select pleas in the Manorial Courts” we find numerous cases
of complaints against manorial tenants for attempting to make
hedges, banks, or such barriers.</p>

<p>At Bledlow, in Northamptonshire, “it is presented that John
Le Pee has unlawfully thrown up a bank” in 1275 (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</cite>). In
Hemingford (Huntingdon) that “William Thomas Son has
planted willows in the bank unlawfully” in 1278 (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 90</cite>), and in
the same manor “Elias Carpenter has wrongfully planted trees
on a boundary” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 92</cite>). In Weedon Beck (Northamptonshire)
in 1296 “Walter Mill complains of John Brockhole and says
that he has raised a wall and hedge between their tenements
to his damage.”</p>

<p>One is tempted to associate the early and complete enclosure
of Kent, without Acts of Parliament, with the proverbial wealth
and importance of the Kentish yeomen, and the custom of
Gavelkind (<i>i.e.</i>, the equal inheritance of landed property by all
sons), which necessarily tended to multiply small properties.</p>

<p>William Marshall’s description of the enclosure of the Vale of
Pickering, the most fertile part of the North Riding of Yorkshire,
occupying the southern slopes of the Yorkshire Wolds, shows a
similar association. In “Rural Economy of Yorkshire,” published
in 1788, we read:&mdash;“A century ago the marginal townships
lay perhaps entirely open, and there are vestiges of common fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
in the area of the vale. The West Marshes, church property, have
been longer under inclosure; and the central townships were
probably inclosed long before those of the margin; the soils of
that part being adapted to grass; and while the surrounding
country lay open, grass land was of singular value. At present
the entire vale may be said to be in a state of inclosures (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17</cite>).</p>

<p>“Lands are much in the hands of small owners, in general,
in the occupation of yeomanry; a circumstance, this, which it
would be difficult to equal in so large a district” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19</cite>).</p>

<p>He notices (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20</cite>) that it was the custom to divide lands
among all the children, and (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 24</cite>) that the custom of sale of
tenant right existed.</p>

<p>“In the present century, more especially in the last fifty
years, enclosure has made a rapid progress.... In my own
remembrance more than half the vale lay open” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 50</cite>).</p>

<p>The township of Pickering itself lay open at the beginning of
the century. It then had 2376 acres of common field arable,
stinted pastures, and 3700 acres of common. “The common
fields and common meadows have been gradually contracting by
amicable changes and transfers, and are now, in a manner,
wholly inclosed. The stinted pastures have, at different times,
been inclosed ‘by commission,’  namely, by the unanimous
reference to arbitrators.”<a name="Anchor_80" id="Anchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_80" id="Footnote_80" href="#Anchor_80" title="Return to text.">[80]</a> An older description of piecemeal enclosure is given by John Houghton:
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Would they who plough in champain grounds but change their little parcels;
would they who have 6 or 8 acres together make a ditch of 6 or 7 foot wide and
deep, and fill it if they would with water, and carry away the bank that it might
not be thrown in again, hedges might chance to thrive, and in 2 years (tho’
they to please the people might at certain times lay it open) they would raise
more money than they use to do in six.</span>” (<cite><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Collections</span>, September 16th, 1681,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16</cite>.) This gives me a pretty fair idea both of the profit and of the
unpopularity of such enclosure at the time.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>In general, it may be said, that the Parliamentary enclosure
of a given parish indicates that the manorial authority was
exercised during a long period antecedent to the enclosure, to
prevent gradual enclosure by individual tenants; and that the
existence of important rights and properties belonging to the
lord of the manor prevented a common agreement to enclose by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the actual cultivators of the soil from being reached and put
into execution.</p>

<p>It may also be noticed that in a parish or township where
there is no one principal landlord, but a number of landowners
owning moderate properties, there is comparatively little
likelihood of the net profit of an Enclosure Act seeming to any
one owner worth the trouble of initiating a movement to
promote one; and a comparatively greater likelihood of some
owner or owners being found disposed, from private grudges or
on public grounds, to oppose the proceedings.</p>

<p>This distribution of property in a common field parish
increases the probability that enclosure will proceed in a piecemeal
fashion, instead of by an Act.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Enclosure under the General Acts of 1886 and 1840.</h3>

<p>In 1836 a general Act (<cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 115</cite>) was passed “to facilitate the
Inclosure of Open and Arable Fields in England and Wales.”
By this Act two-thirds in number and value of the proprietors
of lands and common rights in Arable Common Fields could
appoint Commissioners for Enclosure, provided such fields were
not within ten miles of the centre of London, or three miles
from the centre of some town of over 100,000 inhabitants, or
within certain smaller distances of smaller towns. Enclosure
so effected was only recorded locally. Awards had to be
deposited in the parish churches; but no confirming Act was
needed. If seven-eighths in number and value of the proprietors
were agreed upon enclosure, it was not necessary for them even
to appoint Commissioners, if they could come to an agreement as
to the redistribution of properties.</p>

<p>In 1840 an amending Act (<cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 31</cite>) was passed, providing that
persons who took possession of the allotments awarded them in
enclosures under the Act of 1836 must be deemed to have waived
the right of appeal from the award. The scope of the Act of
1836 was also extended to Lammas meadows.</p>

<p>As these Acts were in operation from 1836 to 1845, the
enclosures effected by special Acts of Parliament during this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
period must have been greatly outnumbered by those effected
during that period without being recorded by the central Government.
Between 1845 and 1852 the enclosure of lands which
were neither commonable all the year round nor subject to any
common rights not regulated by a stint, could be effected by the
Enclosure Commissioners without being reported to Parliament;
but after 1852 the Enclosure Commissioners had to report all
their proceedings.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Enclosure in Corn-growing and Pastoral Districts.</h3>

<p>The arable common fields, and in consequence the commonable
meadows with intermixed ownership, which were
situated in districts predominantly pastoral, tended, other
things being equal, to be divided and enclosed earlier than the
common fields in the predominantly corn-growing districts. For
this there are various reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly, as may be seen from the maps of Castor and
Ailesworth, of Laxton, of <a href="#braunton" title="Go to the map of Braunton Great Field.">Braunton</a> (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 250</cite>), or of any maps of
any common-field parishes, piecemeal enclosure tends to begin in
the arable fields (<i>a</i>) close to the village, and (<i>b</i>) on the outermost
margin of the fields. The greater the extent of the fields,
the longer, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, will it be before piecemeal enclosure
completely obliterates them.</p>

<p>Secondly, enclosure in a pastoral district does not arouse the
same resentment and popular resistance that it does in a corn-growing
district. This is easily seen from all the controversial
writings of the whole period during which enclosure has been a
matter of controversy, up to about the middle of the nineteenth
century. It was not enclosure as enclosure that offended, but
enclosure as causing, or as being intended to result in, the
laying down of arable land in grass; as being, in the words of
Joseph Bentham of Kettering, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the inhuman practices of
madded and irreligious depopulators</span>”<a name="Anchor_81" id="Anchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> which robbed the king
of subjects and the country of corn and cattle. Those who
enclosed were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">monsters of men, dispeoplers of towns, ruiners
of the commonwealth as far as in them lyeth, occasioners of
beggars and beggery, cruell inclosiers, whose Adamantine hearts
no whit regard the cries of so many distressed ones.</span>”<a name="Anchor_82" id="Anchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> Such
denunciation would be out of place, and the passions which gave
rise to it would never have arisen, in a predominantly pastoral
district, because there would be in such a district comparatively
few persons thrown out of employment even if the enclosure
were of the arable fields only; and because it is scarcely possible
that while enclosure of the arable fields was going on, there
would not be simultaneous enclosure of waste land, which would
have to be repeatedly ploughed and tilled even if the intention
were to ultimately convert it into permanent pasture. In other
words, while enclosure in a predominantly corn-growing district
is associated with “depopulation,” in a pastoral district it is
associated with increased employment, increased local population,
a larger production of food, and on the whole increased
local prosperity. Thus, though there was a rebellion in Devon
and Cornwall in 1549, the same year as Ket’s rebellion,
enclosure was not one of the complaints of the rebels. And
this was not because enclosure had not begun in Devon and
Cornwall, because, as a matter of fact, enclosure had advanced
further in Devon and Cornwall than in most other counties.
The attitude of the Cornishmen is thus expressed by Carew:&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">They
fal everywhere from Commons to Inclosure, and partake
not of some Eastern Tenants envious dispositions, who will
sooner prejudice their owne present thrift, by continuing this
mingle-mangle, than advance the Lords expectant benefit, after
their terme expired.</span>”<a name="Anchor_83" id="Anchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, there was, during one period in the sixteenth century,
a law specially guarding the corn-growing districts from enclosure,
from which other districts were exempt.</p>

<p>The <cite>Statute 7 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1</cite>, was the Depopulation Act in
force for the 20 years 1516–1536. It derives special importance
from the Inquisition into Enclosures which followed its enactment,
in 1517. It applies only to parishes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Whereof the more
part was or were used and occupied to tillage and husbandrie</span>”;
and it required the land to be tilled “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">after the maner and
usage of the countrey where the seyd land lyeth</span>.” This restriction
drops out of the next Depopulation Act, 27 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>,
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 22, passed in the year 1536.</p>

<p>In the year 1536 Leland, the King’s Antiquary, began his
Itinerary, which lasted till 1542. Whether in consequence of
special instructions or not, he almost everywhere notes the condition
of the country he traverses with regard to enclosure. A
summary of his observations is shown in the form of a map;
Devon, Cornwall, West Somerset, South Wales, Hereford,
Worcester, the north-west of Warwick, South Lancashire, the
country round Southampton, and near Hampton Court, with
parts of Yorkshire, are shown to be the most enclosed districts
which are described; and the districts described by Leland as
<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaign</span> are those which were later largely enclosed by Act
of Parliament.</p>

<p>The general movement of agricultural progress, it may safely
be assumed, up to Leland’s time, was from the south-east of
England northwards and westwards. The extreme south-east
corner was certainly very early enclosed, as one would naturally
expect, but we also find remote western districts, where one
would naturally expect to find old customs linger comparatively
late, precede the central districts in the abandonment of the
“village community,” by many years.<a name="Anchor_84" id="Anchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84" href="#Anchor_84" title="Return to text.">[84]</a> How long the enclosure of certain western counties preceded the enclosure
of the east midlands, is shown by comparing the two following extracts. Of
the former, Joseph Lee, in “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A Plea for Regulated Inclosure</span>,” published 1656,
asks, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Are not many places in England, Essex, Hereford, Devonshire, Shropshire,
Worcester, wholly enclosed?</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31</cite>). Of the latter the “<cite>General Report
on Enclosures</cite>,” published 152 years later, “A village of farmers and labourers
surrounding a church and environed by three or four and in a few cases by five
open fields, form the spectacle of Cambridge, Huntingdon, and Northampton
shires, as much as on the Loire and on the plains of Moscow” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 25</cite>).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Whether much of the enclosure which Leland saw in 1536
had been the work of the previous twenty years, it is of course
impossible to say; but making any reasonable allowance for progress
in hedging and ditching in the western counties where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
agriculture was mainly pastoral during those twenty years, and
assuming that the Act of 1516 had effectually stopped enclosure
in that period in the corn-growing districts, one can hardly
resist coming to the conclusion that if Leland had made his
journey in 1516 he would then also have found enclosure most
advanced in those districts which were most enclosed in
1536.</p>

<p>What we have, then, to ask is whether the priority of enclosure
in the western counties is to be attributed entirely to the fact of
their being devoted more to grass and less to tillage, or whether
there was some difference in the primitive village community of
the west which caused cultivated land to pass more easily into
the condition of exclusive ownership and separate use. Obviously
we must look for the answer to this question beyond the
boundaries of England. To understand the differences between
the village life of those parts of England which were once the
Danelagh, Mercia and Wessex, from those which were then
West Wales and Strathclyde, which may be regarded as at least
semi-Celtic, we must examine the purely Celtic type of village
community.</p>

<p>But it must also be noticed that there is one characteristic
feature of the typical English village community, namely the
importance attached to the right of common pasturage on the
fallow field, and in the other arable fields after harvest, which
would probably never have developed in any part of the country
where only a small proportion of the land was ploughed. There
would be too little profit and too much inconvenience attached
to the exercise of the right for it to have a chance of being
established, or if established, of persisting.</p>

<p>Lastly, it seems to me impossible to account for the perfect
definition of the two boundaries between parishes early enclosed,
without special Acts, and parishes enclosed late by special Acts,
the one in the south-east, passing through Suffolk, Essex, and
between Surrey and Kent, and the other in the south-west,
passing through Somerset and Dorset, except on the assumption
that the enclosure movement beginning in these two corners of
England, was suddenly checked when it had reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
limits indicated, by the Tudor series of Depopulation Acts,
and by the Inquisitions and other measures taken to enforce
them. These Acts specially stipulated for the continuance
of the ancient customary methods of tillage. A summary
of their provisions which affect enclosure will be found in

<h2 title="XV. RUN-RIG AND COMMON FIELD" id="chapter_15"><span class="sh_cont">CHAPTER <abbr title="15">XV.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="sub_head">RUN-RIG AND COMMON FIELD.</span></h2>

<p>It is a familiar fact that the early open field system of
agriculture of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, known as run-rig or
rundale, differed in some important features from the common
field system of England.</p>

<p>The mere fact suggests a series of questions with regard to
the relationships between common field and run-rig; whether,
for instance, the more complex common field system was evolved
from the more simple and primitive run-rig system; or supposing
the two not connected, whether a boundary can be defined on
one side of which the early agriculture was of the English
type and on the other of the Celtic type; and again, if
so, which parts of England lie on the Celtic side of the
boundary, and which, if any, of Wales and Scotland lie on the
English side.</p>

<p>Obviously before considering such questions it is necessary to
have a clear grasp of the nature of run-rig, and of the differences
between it and the English system.</p>

<p>In the year 1695 the Scotch Parliament passed an Act allowing
anyone “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">coterminous heritor</span>” owning a share in a “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">commonty</span>”
to have his portion separate from the rest, and to enclose it;
and a series of cases established a defined system of computing
the share of the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">commonty</span>” to which the lord of the manor
as such was entitled in lieu of manorial rights. This caused
the process of the separation of intermixed properties in open
fields to proceed without the intervention of special Acts of
Parliament, except for Royal burghs. Also while in England
under Enclosure Acts or agreements to enclose the three processes
of (<i>a</i>) the separation of intermixed and intercommonable
properties, (<i>b</i>) the separation of intermixed and intercommonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
holdings, and (<i>c</i>) the hedging or fencing of the separated
properties, were accomplished by one continuous series of actions
on the part of those concerned, in Scotland it was otherwise.
The separation of properties where necessary was first accomplished,
and for long afterwards the system of run-rig was
followed by groups of tenants on the same estate. After run-rig
had been abandoned, the separate holdings remained open and
unenclosed, and the process of building dykes or planting hedges
was carried out at a later date, and by slow degrees.</p>

<p>The abandonment of run-rig was general, according to the
reports to the Board of Agriculture, in the lowlands of Scotland
about the year 1730. In the county of Perth up to the year
1744 “the land was always occupied in run-rigg, either by the
different tenants on the same farm, and sometimes by coterminous
heritors. The houses were in clusters for the mutual
protection of the inhabitants.” (<cite>James Robertson, D.D.,
“Agriculture of the Southern District of Perth,” 1794, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 22,
23.</cite>) In the northern and Highland counties the transition was
naturally later. Sir John Sinclair (“<cite>General View of the Agriculture
of the Northern Counties and Islands of Scotland</cite>”) describes
the cultivated land of the Islands as being open almost everywhere,
except in the case of the “mains” or manor farms, the
glebe lands, and the farms of a few principal tacksmen. Of
Caithness he says, “The greater part of the arable land in this
county is occupied by small farmers who possess it in <i>run-rig</i>,
or in <i>rig and rennal</i>, as it is here termed, similar to the common
fields of England, a system peculiarly hostile to improvement”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 207</cite>). But in the Orkneys “Much of the land that formerly
lay in the state known in Scotland under the name of run-rig
land has been divided, but much still remains in the same
situation” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 227</cite>); and the process of enclosing had begun
even in the Shetlands (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 252</cite>).</p>

<p>Turning westwards, we find that in the inner Hebrides 1850
was the date at which the run-rig system finally died out, in a
manner and under conditions which will demand further
attention. But it survived in the Outer Hebrides to a considerably
later date. A very full and interesting description by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Alexander Carmichael is given in Skene’s <cite>“Celtic Scotland,”
<abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> chapter <abbr title="10">x.</abbr></cite></p>

<p>“Old systems are tenacious. They linger long among a rural
people and in remote places. Of these is the land system of run-rig
(<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Mor Barann</span>) which characterises more or less the land
system of the Western Isles. The outer Hebrides are called the
Long Island. They are a series of islands 119 miles in length,
and varying from half-a-mile to twenty miles in breadth. This
kite-like chain of forty inhabited and upwards of a hundred and
fifty uninhabited islands contains a population of 40,000. Much
of this land is held by extensive tacksmen on leases (Fir Baile),
and there being no intermediate tenantry, the rest of the land
is occupied by small tenants at will without leases. These
number 4,500, the majority of whom fish as well as farm.</p>

<p>“The country is divided into townlands of various extent.
The arable land (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Fearann Grainsich</span>) occupied by the small
tenants of these townlands is worked in three ways&mdash;as crofts
wholly, as crofts and run-rig combined, and as run-rig wholly.
In Lewis and Harris the arable land is wholly divided into crofts:
in Uist and Barra the arable land is divided in part into crofts,
and in part worked in run-rig; while in the townlands of Hosta,
Coolas Paipil, and the island of Heisgeir in North Uist, the
arable land is worked exclusively upon the run-rig system of
share and share alike. The grazing land of the tenants of each
townland throughout the Long Island is held in common (in
Lewis called <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Comhpairt</span>).</p>

<p>“The soil varies from pure sand to pure moss. Along the
Atlantic there is a wide plain of sandy soil called <i><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Machair</span></i>. This
merges into a mixture of sand and moss (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Breacthalamh</span>, or
mottled soil), which again merges into pure moss (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Mointeach</span>)
towards the Minch. As the soil is dry and sandy, if the summer
is dry the crop is light. On the other hand, if the summer is
moist the crop is heavy and good. In order that all may have
an equal chance, the <i><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Machair</span></i> belonging to them is equally
divided among the tenants of the township. Obviously the man
who is restricted to his croft has fewer advantages than the
man who, together with his croft, has his share of the <i><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Machair</span></i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
and still fewer advantages than the man who has, rig for rig with
his neighbours, the run of the various soils of his townland, which
gives name to the system. Consequently a wet or dry season
affects the tenant of the croft system more than the tenant of
the combined system, and the tenant of the combined system
more than the tenant of the run-rig system.</p>

<p>“The townland of Hosta is occupied by four, Ceolas Paipil
by six, and the island of Heisgeir by twelve tenants. Towards
the end of autumn, when harvest is over, and the fruits of the
year have been gathered in, the constable calls a meeting of
the tenants of the townland for <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Nabachd</span> (neighbourliness).
They meet, and having decided upon the portion of land to be
put under green crop next year, they divide it into shares
according to the number of tenants in the place, and the
number of shares in the soil they respectively possess. Thereupon
they cast lots, and the share which falls to a tenant he
retains for three years. A third of the land under cultivation
is thus divided every year. Accordingly the whole cultivated
land of the townland undergoes revision every three years.
Should a man get a bad share he is allowed to choose his share
in the next division. The tenants divide the land into shares
of uniform size. For this purpose they use a rod several
yards long, and they observe as much accuracy in measuring
their land as a draper in measuring his cloth. In marking the
boundary between shares, a turf (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Torc</span>) is dug up and turned
over the line of demarcation. The <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">torc</i> is then cut along the
middle, and half is taken by the tenant on one side, and half
by the tenant on the other side, in ploughing the subsequent
furrow; similar care being afterwards exercised in cutting the
corn along the furrow. The tenant’s portion of the run-rig is
called <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cianag</span>, and his proportion of the grazing ground for
every pound he pays <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Coir-sgoraidh</span>.</p>

<p>“There are no fences round the fields. The crop being thus
exposed to injury from the cattle grazing along the side, the
people have a protecting rig on the margin of the crop. This
rig is divided transversely into shares, in order to subject all
tenants to equal risks.... Occasionally, and for limited bits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
of ground, the people till, sow, and reap in common, and divide
the produce into shares and draw lots. This is called <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Comachadh</i>,
promiscuous. The system was not uncommon in the
past, though now nearly obsolete.</p>

<p>“In making their own land arrangements for the year, the
tenants set apart a piece of land towards the support of the
poor....</p>

<p>“In reclaiming moor-land the tenants divide the ground into
narrow strips of five feet wide or thereby. These strips, called
lazy-beds (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Feannagan</span>, from <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">feann</span>, to scarify), the tenants allot
among themselves according to their shares or crofts. The
people mutually encourage one another to plant as much of
this ground as possible. In this manner much waste ground
is reclaimed and enhanced in value, the ground hitherto the
home of the stonechat, grouse, snipe and sundew, is made to
yield luxuriant crops of potatoes, corn, hay and grass. Not
unfrequently, however, these land reclamations are wrested
without acknowledgment from those who made them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>“The sheep, cattle and horses of the townland graze together,
the species being separate. A tenant can only keep
stock conformably to his share in the soil. He is however at
liberty to regulate the proportions of the different kinds, provided
that his total stock does not exceed his total grazing
rights. He can keep a greater number of one species and a
corresponding smaller number of another. Or he can keep
a greater number of the young, and a corresponding less
number of the old of the same species, or the reverse. About
Whitsuntide, when the young braird appears, the people remove
their sheep and cattle to the grazing ground behind the arable
land. This is called clearing the townland. The tenants bring
forward their stock (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Leibhidh</span>) and a souming (<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sumachadh</span>) is
made. The <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Leibhidh</i> is the tenant’s stock, the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sumachadh</i> the
number he is entitled to graze in common with his neighbours.
Should the tenant have a croft, he is probably able to graze
some extra stock thereon, though this is demurred to by his
neighbours. Each ‘penny’  of arable lands has grazing rights
of so many soums. Neither, however, is the extent of land
in the penny, nor the number of animals in the soum uniformly
the same.”</p>

<p>A soum consists of a cow and her progeny; in some places
the cow and her calf only: in some a cow, her calf, her one-year-old
progeny (called a <i>stirk</i>) and her two-year-old <i>quey</i>; in
other places again, the cow, calf, stirk, quey and a three-year-old
heifer. At four years old the heifer becomes a cow, and so
originates a fresh soum.</p>

<p>In making souming calculations, it is assumed that one cow
is equal to two queys or to four stirks or to eight calves, or to
one heifer and one stirk. Also one cow is equal to eight sheep,
or to twelve hoggs (one-year-old sheep) or to sixteen lambs or
to sixteen geese. One mature horse is equal to two cows; also
to eight foals, or to four one-year-old colts or fillies, or to two
two-year-olds, or to one three-year-old and one colt or filly.
The cow is entitled to her calf; and if one tenant has two cows
without calves they are entitled to take one stirk instead.</p>

<p>Those tenants who are found at the souming to have overstock
must either buy grazing from a tenant who has understock or
may be allowed by the community to let the overstock remain
on the grass till he can dispose of it. In that case payment
must be made, according to a recognised code, into a common
fund which is used to buy bulls or tups or for some other
common purpose. The souming is amended at Lammas, and
again at Hallowtide.</p>

<p>In Lewis and Harris similar arrangements with regard to
stock obtain among the <i>crofters</i>, the amount of stock allowed to
each crofter being regulated according to the rent paid.</p>

<p>During the early summer the herds are put at night into
enclosures, according to the species, and two tenants, chosen in
rotation, keep watch to prevent them from straying over the
open fields. If they escape, the watchmen are fined and have
to make any damage good, but the fines, and the amount
assessed for damages, both go into the common fund.</p>

<p>Early in June, the tillage being finished, the people go to the
hill grazing with their flocks. The scene is vividly described
by Mr. Carmichael, the general excitement, the men shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
directions, the women knitting and chatting, the children
scampering about. Sheep lead the procession, cattle come next,
the younger ones preceding the older, the horses follow. Implements
and materials are carried to repair the summer huts.
When the grazing ground is reached the huts are repaired, fires
lit, and food cooked. The people bring forward their stock
into an enclosure, and the constable and another man stand at
the gate of the enclosure and count each man’s stock separately
to see that he has brought only his proper souming. Then the
cattle are turned out to graze, and the “Shealing Feast” is
celebrated by the singing of hymns and the eating of cheese.
The summer huts are of a beehive shape, and are sometimes
constructed of stone, and sometimes of turf and frail materials.<a name="Anchor_85" id="Anchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85" href="#Anchor_85" title="Return to text.">[85]</a> The ruins of beehive huts all over Dartmoor, and of enclosures like Grimspound,
are conceivably evidence of similar customs in Devonshire. Now, however,
the care of the cattle pastured on Dartmoor by the occupiers of adjacent
farms, is a distinct occupation. Those who follow it are called “Moor-men.”
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Each tenant under the run-rig system is responsible for his
own rent only. Formerly the rent was paid partly in money,
partly in meal, partly in butter and cheese, and partly in
cattle.</p>

<p>The common functionaries, the shepherd, cattleherd and
marchkeeper, are paid by their co-tenants for their services
in seaweed, land and grazing. The business of the marchkeeper
is to watch the open marches of the townland and prevent
trespass. He may also have the duty of watching the shore to
see when the seaweed is cast upon it. Then he erects a pole
with a bunch of seaweed at the end, and the people come down
to the shore to collect the weed for manure. No tenant is
permitted to take seaweed till his neighbours arrive, unless the
custom prevails of collecting the weed in common, dividing
it into shares and casting lots.</p>

<p>When required by the proprietor or the people, the constable
convenes a meeting of the inhabitants. At such meetings the
questions in dispute are settled, after full discussion, by votes;
lots are drawn if the votes are equal.</p>

<p>“The closer the run-rig system is followed, the more are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the unwritten customs and regulations observed. The more
intelligent tenants regret a departure from them....</p>

<p>“The houses of the tenants form a cluster. In parts of
Lewis the houses are in a straight line called <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Straid</i>, street,
occasionally from one to three miles in length. They are
placed in a suitable part of the townland, and those of the
tenants on the run-rig system are warm, good and comfortable.
These tenants carry on their farming operations simultaneously,
and not without friendly and wholesome rivalry, the enterprise
of one stimulating the zeal of another....</p>

<p>“Not the least pleasing feature in this semi-family system
is the assistance rendered by their neighbours to a tenant whose
work has fallen behind through accident, sickness, death, or
other unavoidable cause....</p>

<p>“Their mode of dividing the land and of equalising the stock
may seem primitive and complex to modern views, but they are
not so to the people themselves, who apply them amicably,
accurately and skilfully. The division of the land is made with
care and justice. This is the interest of all, no one knowing
which place may fall to himself, for his neighbour’s share may
become his own three years hence.</p>

<p>“Whatever may be the imperfections, according to modern
notions, of this very old semi-family system of run-rig husbandry,
those tenants who have least departed from it are the most comfortable
in North Uist, and, accordingly, in the Outer Hebrides.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carmichael informs me that the whole of this description
held good at least up to May, 1904.</p>

<p>The brief descriptions and other references to the run-rig
system of the agricultural writers whom Sir John Sinclair and
Arthur Young enlisted in the service of the Board of Agriculture
at the end of the eighteenth, and the beginning of the nineteenth
century, are sufficient to show that in all essential features it
was fundamentally identical in different parts of Scotland. Sir
John Sinclair’s own description is meagre and unsympathetic:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>“Were there twenty tenants and as many fields, each tenant
would think himself unjustly treated unless he had a proportionate
share in each. This causes treble labour, and as they
are perpetually crossing each other, they must be in a state of
constant quarrelling and bad neighbourhood. In order to prevent
any of the soil being carried to the adjoining ridge, each individual
makes his own ridge as high as possible, which renders
the furrow quite bare, so that it produces no crop, while the
accumulated soil in the middle of the ridge is never stirred
deeper than the plough. The proprietors begin to see the
inconveniences of this system, and in general intend to remedy
it, by dividing the land into regular farms.”<a name="Anchor_86" id="Anchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is obviously a description of run-rig in a state of
decrepitude; the communal spirit has died out of it, and
apparently the practice of periodic redivision of the land has
fallen into desuetude. In another passage<a name="Anchor_87" id="Anchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a> we find a variation
of the method of guarding the crops which again, when compared
with Mr. Carmichael’s description of the “promiscuous rig,”
appears to show the decay of the system. “The tenants have
a miserable sort of fence, made of turf, which separates their
arable land from the adjoining waste; but it requires constant

neglected, and the country becomes one immense common, over
which immense numbers of cattle are straggling in search of
food, greatly to the injury of the soil.”</p>

<p>William Marshall, the rival as an agricultural writer and
bitter critic of Arthur Young, supplied the “General View of
the Agriculture of the Central Highlands of Scotland.” He
supplies us with one significant hint, if we need it, with regard
to the fundamental basis of run-rig: “Not the larger farms
only, but each subdivision, though ever so minute, <i>whether
‘plow-gait,’  ‘half-plow,’  or ‘horse-gang,’</i>  has its pittance of hill
and vale, and its share of each description of land, as arable,
meadow, green pasture and <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">muir</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 29</cite>). By the way, even
smaller farms than the “horse-gang,” <i>i.e.</i>, one quarter of the
arable land which could be ploughed by a four-horse plough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
together with the corresponding proportion of meadow, pasture
and moor, were to be found on the Royal burghs where intermixed
ownership was exempt from the operation of the Act of
1695. On these the smallest farms consisted of a “horse’s foot”
of land, <i>i.e.</i>, one sixteenth part of a “plow-gait.”</p>

<p>Dr. James Robertson defines run-rig as “Two or three or
perhaps four men yoking their horses together in one plough, and
having their ridges alternately in the same field, with a bank of
unploughed land between them, by way of march.”<a name="Anchor_88" id="Anchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a></p>

<p>James McDonald, writing in 1811 a later report on the
Agriculture of the Hebrides, published in 1811, gives an account of
the beginning of the disappearance of run-rig in those islands.
“Mr. Maclean of Coll insisted upon some of his tenants dividing
among them the land which they formerly held in common, or run-rig,
and which they were accustomed for ages to divide annually
by lot, for the purposes of cultivation. They obeyed with great
reluctance, and each tenant had his own farm to himself. Three
or four years’ experience has convinced them now that their
landlord acted wisely.... The same thing happened on various
other estates, and especially in Mull, Tyree and Skye” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 133</cite>).
But the general disappearance of run-rig in these islands took
place about the middle of the nineteenth century, and was the
consequence of the temporary prosperity produced by the rise
of the kelp industry. This led to extreme subdivision of holdings
by sub-letting, the body of small crofters so created relying in
the main upon the kelp industry for a livelihood, and using
their crofts as a subsidiary means of subsistence (<cite>Skene,
“Celtic Scotland,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>  <abbr title="10">x.</abbr></cite>).</p>

<p>It is clear that the two essential features of run-rig are (1)
that it is based upon co-aration, several farmers yoking their
horses to one plough, and tilling the land in partnership; just
as the English common-field system was also based upon co-aration,
with the difference that in England, in general, at the time that
co-aration was practised, the plough was generally drawn by
eight oxen instead of by four horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>(2) That run-rig has a special distinctive feature in the
periodical division and re-division of the land, and that in the
Hebrides, at least, this feature survived after co-aration had
become obsolete.<a name="Anchor_89" id="Anchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> In this respect the Scotch agricultural
community resembles that of Great Russia, where also the
periodical re-division of the open fields, so as to make the shares
proportional to the working power of each family, persists after
co-aration has disappeared.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89" href="#Anchor_89" title="Return to text.">[89]</a> Mr. A. N. Palmer, in his important work, “<cite>A History of Ancient Tenures of
Land in the Marches of <abbr title="North">N.</abbr> Wales</cite>,” expresses the opinion that co-aration and
the shifting of land disappeared simultaneously in North Wales, and had come
to an end by the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 36, note</cite>).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>That throughout the British Isles, and indeed throughout
Northern Europe, the earliest tillage of the soil by ploughs was
accomplished by the method of co-aration, scarcely admits of
doubt; nor is it easy to doubt that before the possibility of
improving the crop by manure was discovered, there was no
permanent occupation by one of the partners in the ploughing,
of any particular set of strips so ploughed.</p>

<p>But it is also obvious that whereas we know that in some
places, as in the Hebrides and in Russia, the idea of common
occupation of the land persisted, after co-aration had ceased, and
displayed itself in the form of periodic or occasional re-division
of the arable land, it is equally possible for the permanent
occupation of certain strips of land to be definitely allotted to
some individuals, while the practice of co-aration is still persistent
among other individuals of the same community. In the latter
case when individual cultivation begins, the peasant who drives
his own plough team, drives it over the same set of strips of
land as had previously been ploughed by the common plough;
he feels more than ever that they are his own, and that he must
guard them against encroachment; though, perhaps, he is not
averse, when occasion offers, to widen his strips at the expense
of his neighbours. The consequence is that by the time individual
cultivation has entirely superseded co-operative ploughing
in any particular village, freeholds and copyholds are definitely
arranged as we know them in the English common fields.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Particularly is this likely to be the case if a long interval of
time elapses between the first beginning of individual ploughing
and the last disappearance of combined ploughing.</p>

<p>If on the other hand the practice of periodic re-allotment of
the land persists up to the time when co-aration ceases, it will
obviously be natural for the peasants when they dissolve their
plough-partnership, to allot their land to one another with some
regard for convenience as well as equity. They will naturally&mdash;as
Sir John Sinclair noticed they did&mdash;allot to each household a
share in each particular sort of soil which had previously been
cultivated in common, but each man’s share in each field is
likely to be allotted to him in one piece, or at least in a few,
and not in a number of strips intermixed with those of his
neighbours. Then when at a later period hedging and ditching
begin, each man has his land in a form convenient for enclosure;
and by enclosing it he forms a series of irregular fields, roughly
square, or when oblong, with the length not many times exceeding
the width. No throwing of the parish into the melting
pot, either by a private Act of Parliament or by a voluntary
submission to a Commission, was necessary in order to effect
enclosure.</p>

<p>On the one hand, then, it is obvious that the great inequality
of the holdings held by servile and semi-servile tenures from
the time of Domesday onwards, was favourable to the creation
of the conditions necessary to make piecemeal enclosure difficult.
The <i>socmanni</i> or <i>francigenae</i>, who held a whole carucate
or ploughland apiece, presumably also had, as a rule, a whole
ploughteam, and were able to plough for themselves, while
their neighbours, who held yardlands and half-yardlands, <i>i.e.</i>,
one-quarter or one-eighth of a ploughland, could only have
their lands ploughed by the common village ploughs. As soon
as the <i>socmanni</i> and <i>francigenae</i> began to permanently improve
the soil, as for instance by marling, the beneficial results of
which were believed in the eighteenth century to last for at
least twelve years, they would naturally become a practically
insuperable obstacle not only to any re-division of the land, but
also to any minor variation in the exact position of the ridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
which comprised the different holdings. Once one such holding
was definitely located, the fixing of all other holdings which were
intermixed with it would follow: every increase of certainty
would be an encouragement to any given tenant to improve his
land, and every expenditure of effort by a tenant on permanent
improvement would be an additional motive to him to resist any
changes in the position of his ridges.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the case of land first brought into
cultivation at a later date, when servile tenures had become
obsolete, by “tenants at will” of the lord of the manor, the
assured continued occupation of a defined set of ridges in land
so reclaimed would not arise, even if the original tenants
practised co-aration; and if the original cultivators worked
independently, of course no intermixture of holdings would
ever arise on such holdings.</p>

<p>Hence the very close connection between copyholds, <i>i.e.</i>, the
commuted servile tenures, and common fields, which was observed
as long as common fields were numerous.</p>

<p>To sum up, it is clear that on <i>a priori</i> grounds there are
certain defined conditions in which alone we can expect to find
the peculiarly English type of open-field arable, the type which
most obstinately resists dissolution, persisting until destroyed
by (<i>a</i>) the absorption of all properties into the hands of a single
owner, or (<i>b</i>) a general valuation and redistribution of properties
and holdings. These are that the land must originally have
been tilled by the method of co-aration, and that co-aration
must have persisted until after some at least of the holdings
had become a definite set of strips of land, the position of which
was not shifted from year to year. These conditions, as Seebohm
shows, are the characteristics of the typical English village
community. But they are not to be found in open arable fields
of the Celtic type of run-rig; and they are not to be expected in
lands first brought into cultivation after the disappearance of
serfdom.</p>

<p>We may therefore expect to find enclosure of arable land
proceeding easily, without the necessity for special Acts of
Parliament, and at a comparatively early stage of social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
evolution, on the one hand in Devon and Cornwall, the counties
bordering on Wales, and in Cumberland, Westmoreland and
Lancashire; and on the other hand in districts like the Weald
of Surrey, Kent and Sussex.</p>

<p>That this inference agrees with the facts will be shown in
detail.</p>

<p>Traces of run-rig, however, both in the form of characteristic
terms, and of records of local custom, are not confined entirely
to the counties within or near the borders of Wales or West
Wales. The Act (<cite>1770 <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 59</cite>) for Matton in Lincolnshire has
for its object to enclose certain commons and “forty-five acres
or thereabouts of antient Toftheads and small Inclosures called
the Town Rig.” To the Act for Barton in Westmoreland
(<cite>1819 <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 83</cite>), which encloses “certain open common fields or
town fields,” which mentions “the dales or parcels of land in
the said common fields or town fields,” there is a parallel in the
Act (<cite>1814 <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 284</cite>), for Gateshead in Durham to enclose “certain
common or town fields, and other commonable lands and
grounds.” These phrases are all reminiscent of the fact that
lands held, or which had previously been held, in run-rig in
Scotland, or in rundale in Ireland, are known as town lands.<a name="Anchor_90" id="Anchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_90" id="Footnote_90" href="#Anchor_90" title="Return to text.">[90]</a> “The Town Fields” indifferently with “The Common Fields” is the name
by which the ancient arable area of Wrexham is called in old deeds, and the
same name is applied to the ancient common fields in many places in North
Wales. (See<cite> A. N. Palmer, “History of Ancient Tenures of Land in the
Marches of North Wales,” <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 1, 2</cite>.)
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Much more striking, however, is the local custom at Stamford,
described in the following passage by Arthur Young: “Lord
Exeter has property on the Lincoln side of Stamford, that
seems held by some tenure of ancient custom among the farmers,
resembling the <i>rundale</i> of Ireland. The tenants divide and plough
up the commons, and then lay them down to become common
again; and shift the open fields from hand to hand in such a
manner, that no man has the same land two years together;
which has made such confusion that were it not for ancient
surveys it would now be impossible to ascertain the property”
(<cite>“General View of the Agriculture of Lincolnshire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</cite>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
William Marshall’s comment is perhaps worth adding: “In
regard to commons, a similar custom has prevailed, and indeed
still prevails, in Devonshire and Cornwall; and with respect to
<em>common fields</em>, the same practice under the name of ‘Run-rig’
formerly was common in the Highlands of Scotland, and, perhaps
in more remote times, in Scotland in general.”</p>

<p>Lastly, it is to be noticed that there is no mention in any
description of run-rig of the arable fields being used as a common
pasture after harvest, or during a fallow year. We shall find
later the same absence of this custom characteristic of English
Common Field, from open arable fields in Cumberland,
Westmoreland, Lancashire, Wales and Devonshire; <i>i.e.</i>, from
the Celtic part of England and Wales. This may, of course,
be a mere coincidence, and the true explanation may in each
be that the stubble was not needed for pasture. But in any
case the absence of rights of pasture over arable fields removes
a great obstacle to piecemeal enclosure.</p>

<h3 title="" class="smcap">Every Year Lands.</h3>

<p>In the chapter on Norfolk agriculture it is shown that the
distinction between Infield and Outfield, which was characteristic
of the agriculture of the Lothians, was also characteristic of the
agriculture of Norfolk; and that a great part of the uninclosed
intermixed arable land was not subject to rights of common, and
was made to bear a crop every year, such land being known as
Every Year lands, Whole Year lands, or Infields.</p>

<p>Here again we were obliged to look to Scotland for further
light upon the customs of an English county, but in this case
we cannot attribute the resemblance between the customs of
Norfolk and the east of Scotland to a common Celtic influence.
The hypothesis would be a difficult one, and a different explanation
presents itself.</p>

<p>Seebohm points out that the ancient characteristic agriculture
of Westphalia, East Friesland, Oldenburg, North Hanover,
Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Brunswick, Saxony and East
Prussia, a vast area comprising all districts from which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain are believed by any historians
to have come, is that known among German scholars as “Einfeldwirthschaft,”
the “one field system.” Crops, usually of rye
and buckwheat, are continually grown year after year, in the
strips in the open fields, the fertility being maintained by marling
and the application of peat manure.<a name="Anchor_91" id="Anchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a></p>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>It is therefore natural to attribute the whole year or every
year lands of Norfolk, and the infields of Scotland, alike, to the
influence of Saxon, Anglian or Danish conquest and settlement.
If it is asked why the same agricultural feature was not more
widely produced, the obvious answer is that when people of
different races are mixed together in the occupation of the same
villages, it is by no means certain that the agricultural customs
which will afterwards prevail will be those of the conquerors, or
of the race which is in the majority. The customs of the first
occupiers had been modified by the environment, and had to some
extent modified the environment, till something like harmony
was created. After a conquest by another race, if any of the
conquered race remain, the <em>easiest</em> course is to continue the
existing mode of husbandry. It is more likely that the customs
of the conquered race should remain as the basis of the future
practice, though altered to some extent in form and more in
spirit, than that the previous customs of the conquerors, which
they had followed in other circumstances on a different soil and
amidst other surroundings, should be imposed on the conquered
people.</p>

<p class="gap">And William Marshall (<cite>“General View of the Agriculture of
the Central Highlands of Scotland,” 1794, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 38</cite>) remarks: “The
every year lands as they are called, of <i>Gloucester</i>, may be said to
be clean compared with those of Breadalbane.” Now, William
Marshall knew the agriculture of Gloucestershire well; and he
was an extremely accurate observer, and more interested in the
local variations of common field cultivation than other agricultural
writers of his time; his authority may therefore be considered
good enough to establish the existence of lands known as every
year lands in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>It is also to be noticed that Acts of Enclosure for Gloucester
and Oxford frequently specify, not “open and common fields”
but “an open and common field,” perhaps of between two and
three thousand acres; and further, as we have previously noted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the Board of Agriculture reporter for Oxfordshire says: “In
divers uninclosed parishes the same rotation prevails over the
whole of the open fields; but in others, the more homeward or
bettermost land is oftener cropped, or sometimes cropped every
year.” Of Gloucestershire, William Marshall says: “In the
neighbourhood of Gloucester are some extensive Common fields
which have been cropped, year after year, during a century, or
perhaps centuries, without the intervening of a whole year’s
fallow. Hence they are called Every Year’s land. Cheltenham,
Deerhurst, and some few other townships, have also their Every
Year’s lands.” On these lands no regular succession of crops is
observed, except that “a brown and a white crop&mdash;pulse and
corn&mdash;are cultivated in alternacy” (<cite>“Rural Economy of
Gloucestershire,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65</cite>).</p>

<p>It may be suggested, further, that a four-year course, such as
we have seen was customary in many places, might possibly
have originated from the custom of cropping the land every year.
The difficulties of maintaining the fertility of the land, and of
keeping it clean, under perennial crops, might very well have
been found insuperable before the introduction of turnip culture,
and the natural remedy, suggested by the two-or three-year
course in neighbouring parishes, would be a periodic fallow. It
is, however, so far as any evidence that can be supplied from
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries goes, equally possible
that the four-year course was a modification of the three-year
course, or that the two-, three-and four-years systems are all
equally ancient; and that the varying customs, not only of
systems of tillage, but also of occupation of meadow land and
regulation of common of pasture, as found in different parts of the
country, have grown up in each district as the result of the
inter-action of Keltic, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse tradition.</p>

<p>If we take this view, which appears to me antecedently probable,
we can see in the Midland or Mercian system a complete blend
of Anglo-Saxon and Keltic custom, in which the specific features
of both of the original strains are lost, and an intermediate, but
perfectly distinct, type of village community resulted. The
Wessex system, both in its feature of lot or rotation meadow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and in the customs of individual cultivation of land for common
benefit, as in the sowing of clover by each occupier to be fed on
by the village flock, compared with the Mercian system, shows a
much closer affinity with Keltic run-rig; while the Norfolk
customs are quite easily accounted for as the result of a fresh
infusion of Teutonic tradition, re-introducing the original one-field
system into villages where that system had previously been
blended with Keltic custom.</p>

<span class="sub_head">COMMON FIELDS IN NEW ENGLAND.</span></h2>

<p>A certain amount of light upon the question when the common
field system lost its vitality, its advantages being completely
overshadowed by its disadvantages, so that only the obstructive
forces which we have considered prevented its disappearance,
is furnished by the fact that the original settlers of New England,
who presumably derived their ideas of agriculture from the
eastern counties of England, reproduced in America a form of
the English village community. No doubt their poverty and
early difficulties compelled them to revert to a further degree of
dependence on mutual help, and so perhaps the form of community
which they there established may have been of a more
primitive type than that which they had left behind, and allowance
must be made for this possibility; and also for the
possibility of effects of the sojourn of the Pilgrim Fathers in
Holland.</p>

<p>The following accounts of the New England common fields
are taken from two papers by Mr. Herbert B. Adams:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Vestiges of the old Germanic system of common fields are
to be found in almost every ancient town in New England. In
the town of Plymouth there are to this day some 200 acres of
Commons known as Town Lands. This tract is largely forest,
where villagers sometimes help themselves to wood in good old
Teutonic fashion.... In the old town of Sandwich, near
Cape Cod, at the point where the ship canal was projected in 1880,
there is a little parcel of 130 acres known as the Town Neck. This
is owned by a company of twenty-four proprietors, the descendants
and heirs of the first settlers in the town, and this tract is
managed to this day as a common field. Originally the Town
Neck with other common lands belonged to the whole town. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> town records of Sandwich I find under date May 22,
1658, this vote: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">If any inhabytant wanteth land to plant, hee
may have some in the Towne Neck, or in the Common for six
yeare and noe longer.</span>’  Later, in 1678, April 6, townsmen are
given liberty to improve Neck lands ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">noe longer than ten
yeares</span> ... <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">and then to be at the townsmen’s ordering
again</span>.’  In the year 1695, the use of the Town Neck was
restricted to the heirs of the original proprietors, and the land
was staked out into 38 lots. The lots were not fenced off, and
the whole tract continued to lie under the authority of the entire
body of proprietors, like the arable fields of a German village
community. In 1696, April 4, it was agreed that the Town
Neck should be improved for the future by planting and sowing
as a common field, until the major part of those interested
should see cause otherwise to dispose or improve the same. The
common fence was to be made up, and a gate to be provided by
the first of May. A field driver or hayward was to keep the
Town Neck clear of creatures and to impound for trespass. In
1700 it was voted that the Neck be cleared of creatures by the
16th of April, and that no part of the land be improved by tillage
other than by sowing.</p>

<p>“And thus from the latter half of the 17th century down to
the present day (May 9, 1881) have the proprietors of Sandwich
Town Neck regulated the use of their old common field. Every
year they have met together in the Spring to determine when
the fences should be set up and how the pasture should be
stinted. The old Commoners’ records are for the most part still
in existence as far back as the year 1693, and before this time
the town records are full of agrarian legislation, for the Town
Neck was then virtually town property. There arose in
Sandwich and in every New England village community the
same strife between old residents and new comers, as between
the Patricians and Plebeians of ancient Rome. The old settlers
claimed a monopoly of public land, and the new comers demanded
a share. In most old New England towns the heirs of original
settlers or of citizens living in the community at a specified date
retained a monopoly of the common lands for many years until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
finally compelled by force of public opinion to cede their claims
to the town. In Sandwich, however, a vestige of the old system
has survived to this day. Every Spring, for many years, has
appeared a public notice (I saw one in the <i><cite>Seaside Press</cite></i>, May 8,
1880) calling together the proprietors of the Town Neck at some
store in the village to choose a moderator and a clerk, and to
regulate the letting of cow rights for the ensuing year....</p>

<p>“There were for many years in the town of Salem certain
common fields owned by associated proprietors just as in the
case of Sandwich Town Neck. Such were the north and south
fields in Salem. The old Commoners’ records of the south
fields are still preserved in the library of the Essex Institute,
and date as far back as 1680. Under the date of October 14th
of that year, I find the following: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Voted that the proprietors
have liberty to put in cattle for herbage&mdash;that is to say 6 cows,
4 oxen, 3 horses or yearlings, or 24 calves to 10 acres of land,
and so in proportion to greater or less quantities of land;
and no person shall cut or strip their Indian corn stalks
after they have gathered their corn, on penalty of forfeiting
herbage.</span>’</p>

<p>“The so-called great pastures of Salem, some 300 acres, are
to this day owned and managed by a small company of proprietors
in common, of whom Dr. Wheatland of the Essex
Institute has been for some years the clerk. He has in his
hands the records of the proprietory, extending back for many
years.</p>

<p>“These records are full of old time regulations in regard to
common fencing, common pasturage, cow commons, sheep
commons and the like.” (<cite>“The Germanic Origin of New England
Towns” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 33</cite>.)</p>

<p>Perhaps still more conclusive are the following decrees of the
legislative body of Massachusetts, which Mr. Adams quotes.
In the spring of 1643 the Massachusetts General Court ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">For preventing disorder in corn feilds <abbr title="which">wᶜʰ</abbr> are inclosed in
common ... that those who have the greater quantity in such
fields shall have power to order the whole, notwithstanding any
former order to the contrary, &amp; that every one who hath any
part in such common feild shall make and maintaine the fences
according to their severall quantities.</span>”</p>

<p>But in the autumn of the same year, the Act was passed:&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Whereas
it is found by experience that there hath bene much
trouble and difference in severall townes about the Manner of
planting, sowing, &amp; feeding of common corne ffeilds &amp; that upon
serious consideration wee find no general order can provide for
the best improvement of every such common feild, by reason
that some consists onely of plowing ground, some haveing a
great part fit onely for planting, some of meadowe and feeding
ground; also so that such an order as may be very wholesome
&amp; good for one feild may bee exceeding preiudiciall &amp; inconvenient
for another, it is therefore ordered, that where the
commoners cannot agree about the manner of improvement of
their feild, either concerning the kind of graine that shalbee
sowen or set therein, or concerning the time and manner of
feeding the herbage thereof, that then such persons in the
severall townes that are deputed to order the prudenciall affaires
thereof, shall order the same, or in case where no such are, then

<span class="sub_head">THE PROGRESS OF ENCLOSURE WITHOUT PARLIAMENTARY
SANCTION.</span></h2>

<h3 title=""> A. FROM 1845 ONWARDS.</h3>

<p>Any statistical account of enclosure without Parliamentary
sanction must necessarily be vague in comparison with the
statements which it is possible to make of enclosure by Act of
Parliament, and must consist of inferences from evidence of
varying value. And, naturally, the evidence in general becomes
scantier in proportion as the period investigated is more
remote.</p>

<p>The Tithe Commutation maps and awards afford the richest
mine of information for the period since 1836. We have seen
that according to the analysis of them published by the Copyhold,
Enclosure and Tithe Commission in 1873, they indicated the
existence at that date of 264,307 acres of common fields. We
have already seen how untrustworthy this estimate is if taken
for a basis for calculating the area of existing common fields,
how inaccurate it was even at the date at which it was published.
But one great source of inaccuracy in it, as we have seen, is the
assumption that no enclosure, other than by Act of Parliament,
took place after the date of Tithe Commutation. If we could
eliminate all other errors, and also get a perfectly accurate statement
of the area of existing common fields, we should then know
how much enclosure of common fields has taken place without
Parliamentary intervention since the date of Tithe Commutation.
This date, of course, is different in different parishes, but the
average date is about 1845.</p>

<p>To eliminate all other errors it would be necessary to go over
all the work again, a task which would take a single investigator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
several years of continual labour, and would not then be
accomplished unless the investigator were himself infallible.
We must therefore be content with an approximate correction.<a name="Anchor_92" id="Anchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92" href="#Anchor_92" title="Return to text.">[92]</a> There are no less than 11,783 separate sets of awards and apportionments,
each with its map. The maps vary in size from about six or seven to over a
hundred square feet each. The apportionments are bulky rolls of parchment.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The tithe maps and awards deposited with the Tithe Commission
cover about three-quarters of the area of England and
Wales. The amount of common field in the other quarter is
estimated on the assumption that in each county the part for
which there are no tithe awards in the custody of the Tithe
Commission contained the same proportion of common field as
the part for which title awards existed. The common fields
thus estimated amount to about two-fifths of the total estimate.
If the particulars given in the return for the different counties
were added up, we should get the statement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap">We have seen that assuming the total of 163,823 acres is
correctly “ascertained,” the estimate of 100,484 acres for the
other parishes is very excessive, because the most frequent
reason for no title documents existing in the custody of the
Tithe Commission is that the commutation of tithes was effected
before 1836 by a local Enclosure Act, which swept away the
common fields.</p>

<p>In consequence, counties which were mainly enclosed by
Acts of Parliament are very partially covered by the tithe
documents; counties which have few or no Acts for enclosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of common fields are nearly entirely so covered. For example,

<p class="gap">Fortunately there is another possible way of calculating the
probable area of common field land which would have been
found in the parishes not covered by tithe documents, if it had
been investigated at about the same date.</p>

<p>Out of the seventy-five parishes enclosed by Act of Parliament
since 1850&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, at a later date than almost all of the tithe
documents&mdash;the Tithe Commission had the maps and awards
of seventy-one&mdash;all, that is, but four. Common fields subsequently
enclosed were to be found in these two classes of parishes in the
proportion of 71 to 4; it is a fair inference that the total area
of common fields, whether subsequently enclosed or not, was
distributed in the same proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>On this assumption we should have the following calculation:&mdash;</p>

<table class="tithe gap" summary="Tithe Commission">
  <tr>
     <th>&nbsp;</th>
     <th class="thsize tdc" colspan="2">Common&nbsp;Field&nbsp;Lands.<br />

  <tr>
    <td class="pl3 tdc">Total</td>
    <td class="nolg"><span class="sum">173,052</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="gap">No probable error in the additional estimate in this calculation
would have an appreciable effect on the total.</p>

<p>Next, as we have noticed above, the “areas ascertained”
require correction. This it is much more difficult to supply
satisfactorily; all that we can do is to determine&mdash;(1) whether
the number given is likely to err by excess or by defect;
(2) whether the error is likely to be large.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the return was to establish the total
amount of waste land subject to common rights, and the proportion
of such land likely to be capable of cultivation. This
part of the work was done with great care, and particularly with
great care not to include any land which was not certainly subject
to common rights. The final figure arrived at was certainly
considerably in defect through the documents on which it
was based failing to mention common rights in all cases where
they existed.</p>

<p>The part of the return relating to common field lands, on the
other hand, was considered of less importance; the explanatory
letter says with regard to them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The common field lands are generally distinguishable by the
particular manner in which they are marked on the tithe maps,
and their extent has been estimated by these maps.” This
means that areas on the tithe maps subdivided by dotted lines
were assumed to be common field lands. This method had the
advantage of comprehensiveness&mdash;it is probable that scarcely any
common field land escaped notice, if there were a tithe map for
the parish in which it existed. I have only detected one error<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of omission. The common fields of Eakring were very considerably
in excess of the 54 acres at which they were estimated.
But on the other hand it has the disadvantage of including with
common field lands numerous cases of properties or holdings
which were inadequately divided from one another by fences or
hedges, but which were not common fields. But it is very hard
to say precisely what percentage ought to be deducted to allow
for this error. Generalising from all the cases in which I have
been able to put estimates for particular parishes to a test, I
should say that more than one-sixth, but less than one-third of
the total should be deducted. Taking the larger fraction, so as
to leave the remainder under-estimated, rather than over-estimated,
we have&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap">The final remainder represents our corrected estimate of the
area of common fields arable and commonable meadows of
intermixed ownership which would now exist if there had been
no enclosure except by Act of Parliament since about the year
1845. The total area of such fields and meadows actually
existing almost certainly does not exceed 30,000 acres. We
therefore may conclude that not less than 70,000 acres have
been enclosed as the result of the consolidation of farms and
properties and voluntary agreements and exchanges, since about
the year 1845, and that not more than 100,000 acres have been
thus enclosed.</p>

<p>The total area of common fields enclosed by Acts since 1845,
together with such meadows and commons as were enclosed
together with common arable fields, is 139,517 acres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>It would therefore appear that such voluntary methods of
enclosure have accounted in this period for an area something
between half as large an area as Enclosure Acts and five-sevenths
of that area.</p>

<p>The proportion of villages in which common fields have been
entirely got rid of by voluntary enclosure during the same
period would of course be smaller; because wherever common
fields exist they are subject to continual diminution by gradual
enclosure; and the final application of an Act of Parliament
may be merely the <i>coup de grace</i>. Curiously, also, it may happen
that a practically complete enclosure may be effected, and years
later resort be had to an Act, as in the cases of Hildersham
(Cambridge), and Sutton (Northampton).</p>

<h3 title="">B. BEFORE 1845.</h3>

<p>The agricultural survey of Great Britain carried out by the
Board of Agriculture in 1793 furnishes us with much information
about the state of enclosure of some counties, and with
scraps of information about others. Where the information is
fullest it may take the form of estimates of the total area
enclosed or open, or the form of information with regard to
particular villages. By correlating the information thus
supplied with that furnished by the Acts themselves, and from
other sources, we can in some cases obtain a fairly full account
of the enclosure history of a county.</p>

<p>The area of Bedfordshire being 298,500 acres, a slight deduction
should be made from the figures under each head. But
this does not affect the two striking points about the estimate:
(1) that over two-thirds of the area of the county was open, and
(2) that the open and commonable land amounted to over
200,000 acres.</p>

<p>The author proceeds: “Every parish which is commonly
understood to be open consists of a certain proportion of antient
inclosed land near the respective villages, but that proportion,
compared with the open common field in each respective parish,
does not on an average exceed one-tenth of the whole” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 25</cite>).</p>

<p>He further says that Lidlington, Sundon and Potton had
been recently enclosed. Each was enclosed by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>We can deal with the above information in two ways: (1) by
translating it into terms of parishes, and (2) by dealing with it
in terms of acres.</p>

<p>In Bedfordshire very little common indeed existed apart from
the open field parishes. This is proved by the fact that from
1700 to 1870 there were only three enclosures of commons,
apart from arable common fields, comprising an area of
867 acres, and that the tithe maps only indicated 507 acres
more of commons in parishes where there were no common
fields. We may safely assume that at least 200,000 acres out
of our author’s 217,200 acres of open land belonged to open
field villages, and that these villages also had, in accordance
with his estimate, 20,000 acres of old enclosures, the area of
all the open fields parishes in 1764 was, according to the
estimate, about 220,000 acres; that of the enclosed parishes
about 87,200 acres. If the numbers of the parishes enclosed
and open were about in the same proportion, out of the one
hundred and twenty-one parishes in Bedfordshire, there should
have been eighty-seven open and thirty-four enclosed.</p>

<p>From the list of Parliamentary enclosures in the <a href="#appendix_b" title="Go to Appendix B.">appendix</a>, it
will be seen that seventy-three parishes were enclosed by Acts
passed in 1798 and later. There were also seven other parishes
in which the tithe documents indicate common fields surviving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
up to the date of Tithe Commission, making a total of eighty
parishes, which we have previously accounted for.</p>

<p>It would follow that about seven parishes were enclosed in
Bedfordshire between 1794 and 1845 without any Act. This is
in accordance with what we might reasonably expect.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-four parishes which by this argument were
enclosed in 1790, seventeen had been enclosed by Acts passed
between the years 1742 and 1783, leaving a remainder of
seventeen parishes. There is obviously a strong probability that
the majority of these were enclosed in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But in this calculation I have treated the 21,900 acres of
woodland as though it were part of the enclosed parishes. If
it be considered to belong indifferently to open and enclosed
parishes, the above calculation must be modified. We then
have ninety-four parishes open in 1793, and twenty-seven
enclosed; fourteen out of the ninety-four would be enclosed
without Parliamentary sanction between 1793 and 1845, leaving
only ten parishes so enclosed at some unknown date earlier
than 1793.</p>

<p>By dealing with the Bedfordshire estimate on the basis of
acreage instead of parishes, I arrive at the following statement
of the history of the enclosure of Bedford:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap">Arthur Young, in June, 1768, travelled through Bedfordshire
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neots, and then close to the boundary between Bedford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and Huntingdon to Kimbolton and Thrapston in Northamptonshire.
He found from Sandy to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neots the country chiefly
open, and that it continued so to Kimbolton and Thrapston;
though with regard to the two latter places he mentions enclosed
pastures (<cite>“Northern Tour,” 2nd Ed., <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 55–59</cite>).
This, so far as it goes, tends to confirm our conclusions.</p>

<p>I am anxious not to lay any undue stress on the above
arithmetical calculations; but I think it is quite clear that up
to the year 1742 the condition of the county of Bedford was that
indicated by Leland’s description.</p>

<p>Leland passed through Bedfordshire in his “<cite>Itinerary</cite>.”
From <cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <abbr title="folios">fols.</abbr> 116–120</cite>, we find that from Higham Ferrers
in Northamptonshire, about 2 miles from the Bedfordshire
boundary, to Bedford (14 miles) was “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaine</span>” from
Wellington village, near Bedford, to Antchille Castle (Ampthill),
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">12 miles almost al by Champayn Grounde, part by corne and
part by Pasture, and sum baren hethy and sandy grounde</span>.”
Then “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">From Antchille to Dunstable <abbr title="10">X</abbr> <abbr title="miles">m.</abbr> or more. First I
passed partely by woddy ground and Enclosures. But after
most parte by champaine Grounde.... And thens to Mergate
al by Champaine a <abbr title="6">vj</abbr> miles.</span>” And so out of Bedfordshire. A
small part of the county was ancient woodland, a smaller part
was cultivated land reclaimed from the forest state, which had
never passed through the common fields system of cultivation,
but almost all was in the condition of the typical open field
parish, common field arable, commonable meadows, and common
pastures, with a certain amount of enclosure round the villages.
It would appear that during the 200 years following Leland’s
journey only an insignificant amount of progress in enclosure
took place in Bedfordshire. This conclusion is not contradicted,
but on the other hand it is not strikingly confirmed by Walter
Blyth (<cite>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The English Improver</span>,” 1649</cite>), who enumerates as
unenclosed “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the south part of Warwick and Worcestershire,
Leicester, Notts, Rutland, some part of Lincoln, Northampton,
Buckingham, some part of Bedfordshire, most part of the Vales
of England, and very many parcels in most counties</span>.”</p>

<p>One further point may be noticed. In Bedfordshire the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
percentage of the total area enclosed by Act of Parliament is
exceptionally high&mdash;46·0 per cent. We find that when we make
allowances for (1) contemporary voluntary enclosure, (2) for
ancient woodland and for some land passing directly from the
forest state into that of separate ownership and occupation,
(3) for some ancient enclosing of land in the immediate vicinity
of villages, there is little or no other enclosure remaining to be
referred to the period before Parliamentary enclosure began&mdash;in
this case the year 1742.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Northampton, Rutland, <abbr title="South East">S.E.</abbr> Warwick and Leicester.</h4>

<p>These four counties may be said to form a definite group, so
far as their enclosure history is concerned. The main facts
of their Parliamentary enclosure are shown in the following

<p class="gap">Like Bedford, they are all counties with a high proportion of
enclosure by Act of Parliament; but they differ from Bedford in
that their enclosure was much more preponderatingly effected in
the eighteenth century. The proportion of eighteenth-century
Acts is particularly high in Leicester, but the proportion of Acts
earlier than 1760 is higher in Warwick than in any other county&mdash;twenty-nine
out of 114. These counties comprise the district
in which the greatest amount of agitation arose against enclosure
in the seventeenth century, and that in which the effect of
enclosure in causing depopulation through decay of tillage was
most marked in the eighteenth century.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Northamptonshire.</h4>

<p>Northamptonshire has 51·5 per cent. of its area covered by Acts
of Parliament for the enclosure of whole parishes, a larger proportion
than any other county. There have been passed in
addition an important Act for extinguishing foreign rights in
Rockingham Forest in 1796, an Act in 1812 for draining and
enclosing Borough Fen, and creating a new parish to be called
Newborough, and three other Acts for enclosing commons or
wastes; the whole area affected by the five Acts being perhaps
15,000 acres. These being included, the total area which has
undergone Parliamentary enclosure reaches 54 per cent. of the
area of the county.</p>

<p>James Donaldson, the Board of Agriculture reporter, says that
of the 316 parishes, 227 were enclosed by 1793, and eighty-nine
were then in open field; and that “half of the inclosed
parishes may be denominated old inclosure.”</p>

<p>Of the eighty-nine parishes, open in 1793, eighty-eight
have been enclosed by Act of Parliament since; so that there
was only one parish enclosed without Parliamentary intervention
from 1793 to 1903, when the last trace of the Northamptonshire
common fields was swept away by the enclosure of Sutton. This
fact is remarkable, it points to a wide diffusion of ownership of
lands and of rights over the land; and it should be associated
with the specially strenuous resistance of Northamptonshire to
enclosure in the reign of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr></p>

<p>The statement that of the enclosed parishes half may be denominated
old enclosure, would be more enlightening if one knew
exactly what Mr. Donaldson meant by old enclosure. But we
find that 113 parishes (which is as near as possible half 227)
were enclosed by Acts passed in the period 1765–1792; if therefore
by “old enclosure” he means enclosure dating back more
than twenty-eight years, his statement would imply that there
was no enclosure without an Act in that period. Nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
parishes were enclosed by Act in the five years 1760–1764,
eighteen in the period 1749–1759, and four earlier. These Acts
altogether account for the enclosure of 153 out of the 227
parishes, and there is evidently a strong balance of probability
that the enclosure of the remaining seventy-two took place
almost entirely before the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Leicestershire.</h4>

<p>R. Monk, the reporter for Leicester, gives as an Appendix a
list of the “Lordships” of that county, with the names of the
Lords of the manors, or chief landowners, and the date of
enclosure, when he could ascertain it. He only knew of ten open
field parishes and of two half open and half enclosed; but, of
these, four, Cold Overton, Cole Orton, Whitwick and Worthington,
have not since been enclosed by Act of Parliament; they must
therefore have been enclosed voluntarily at the end of the
eighteenth or in the first half of the nineteenth century; for
the tithe documents for these parishes do not indicate any
surviving common field. For thirty-five of the parishes not
enclosed by Act of Parliament, Monk gives no information; of
the following fifteen he gives the date of enclosure:&mdash;</p>

<p>Pickwell, he says, was enclosed in 1628, Shenton in 1646, and
Laughton in 1665.</p>

<p>Here, again, in interpreting these statements, we are confronted
with the difficulty of determining what antiquity is implied by
the term “old enclosure,” and also by the difficulty of estimating
what proportion of the parishes described merely as “enclosed”
belonged to any particular epoch of enclosure.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we note (1) that one-third of the open field
parishes known to Monk were enclosed without Acts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
following half-century, (2) that he gives the date of enclosure of
fifteen other parishes for which we have no Acts, which were
enclosed in the previous half-century. It would therefore appear
that a very considerable amount of enclosure was going on, without
Acts of Parliament, during the period in which Parliamentary
enclosure was proceeding rapidly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fact that he can give seventeenth-century
dates for the enclosure of three parishes suggests that
probably a very large proportion of his “old enclosure parishes”
and a fair proportion of his enclosed parishes were enclosed in
the seventeenth century.<a name="Anchor_93" id="Anchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_93" id="Footnote_93" href="#Anchor_93" title="Return to text.">[93]</a> William Pitt, who made a second survey of the agriculture of Leicestershire
for the Board, published in 1809, gives an interesting account of the enclosure
of the vale of Belvoir. This, the north-eastern corner of Leicestershire, was
enclosed between 1760 and 1800; and as a result a complete change in the
cultivation took place; the rich land in the valleys, which had been arable
common fields, was laid down in grass, and the tenants forbidden under heavy
penalties to plough it; while the summits of the hills and edges of the vales,
which had been sheep-runs, were converted into arable land.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Pursuing the inquiry backwards, we find our next source of
information in Celia Fiennes, a lady of Newtontony, who made a
series of rides in the last few years of the seventeenth century.
Newtontony is three miles east of Amesbury, amid the open chalk
hills, or, as she describes it, in the midst of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a fine open champion
country</span>”, and she usually describes the aspect of the country she
passes through. She travelled westwards to Land’s End, eastwards
to Kent, northwards to the Border, and she gives some information
with regard to the state of enclosure of most of the English
counties. She went through both Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire,
but with regard to those two counties gives no
information as to their condition of enclosure. As she is more
apt to notice the presence than the absence of hedges, this, so
far as it goes, confirms our conclusions with regard to Bedfordshire;
and, with regard to Northamptonshire, this small piece of
negative evidence tends to the conclusion that that county
also was almost entirely open in the beginning of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Leicestershire</span>,” she says, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">is a very Rich Country&mdash;Red land,
good corn of all sorts and grass, <em>both fields and inclosures</em>. You
see a great way upon their hills the bottoms full of Enclosures,
woods, and different sorts of manureing and herbage</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 133</cite>).</p>

<p>It is evident that enclosure had considerably advanced; but it
must be noted that “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">fields</span>” with Celia Fiennes means common
fields. It is further to be noted that her description of the
enclosures creeping up the hills implies a process of gradual
enclosure. Of the neighbourhood of Bosworth (in the west of
Leicestershire) she says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">this is a great flatt full of good
Enclosures</span>.” The western side of Leicestershire was therefore
mainly enclosed before 1700, while the north-east was all open
till 1760.</p>

<p>But though enclosure was so far advanced in Leicestershire,
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">their fewell</span>,” Celia Fiennes says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">is but cowdung or Coale</span>.”
The use of cowdung for fuel supplied to advocates of enclosure
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries one of their chief
arguments. Either the hedges of Leicestershire were not yet
able to supply enough wood for fuel, or the old custom continued
although it was as unnecessary as objectionable. In either case
the natural inference is that much of the enclosure of Leicestershire
which Celia Fiennes observed, was then recent.<a name="Anchor_94" id="Anchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94" href="#Anchor_94" title="Return to text.">[94]</a> Arthur Young found the practice still prevalent in Northamptonshire more
than seventy years later: “they collect all the cow-dung from their fields and
daub it in lumps, barns, and stables, to dry for fuel” (<cite>“Eastern Tour,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48</cite>). Edward Lawrence speaks of Yorkshire (evidently the East Riding only
is meant) and Lincolnshire as the counties where the practice prevailed in 1727
(<cite>“The Duty of a Steward to his Lord,” Article 3</cite>).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>This again is confirmed by Walter Blyth, who in the
passage quoted above describes Leicestershire as entirely
open, as well as Northampton, Rutland, and the south part
of Warwick.</p>

<p>Further detailed information is given by the disputants
Joseph Lee, John Moore, and the anonymous writers who
joined in the controversy, who debated the ethics of enclosure
in the Midlands in the years 1653–1657. John Moore, in his
first pamphlet, asks, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Above one hundred touns inclosed in
Leicestershire, how few amongst them all are not unpeopled
and uncorned?</span>” Now it is probably fair to read <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>“above
one hundred” as “about one hundred” or “nearly one
hundred.” The names of some of these are supplied by
Joseph Lee in his “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Vindication of Regulated Enclosure</cite>,” for
he gives (<cite>page 5</cite>) as examples of enclosure without depopulation
the following thirteen parishes in Leicestershire: Market
Bosworth, Carlton, Coten, Shenton, Cadesby (Cadeby), Bilson
(Billesdon), Twicriss, Higham, Golding (Stoke Golding), Little
Glen, Croft, Ashby Magna, and Stapleton, together with Stoke
in Northamptonshire, Upton and Barton, which might be either
in Northampton or in Warwick, and three others, Nelson,
Cosford and Woscot, which I am unable to locate, except
that Cosford was near Catthorp, the extreme south corner of
Leicestershire; for Lee further gives a list of fifteen enclosures
within three miles of Catthorp, in which Cosford and Coten are
included, and also Bigging, Brownsover, Shawell, Streetfield,
Over, Cottesbatch, Pultney, Sturmer, Hallfield, Sister (? Siston),
Moorebarn, Cotes and Misterton (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8</cite>).</p>

<p>Of the former set of townships he says: “They have been
enclosed some twenty, some thirty, some forty or fifty years.”
Of the latter he says: “Most of these Inclosures have been
plowed within thirty years, and the rest are now about to be
plowed.”</p>

<p>It would appear, therefore, that enclosure began in Leicestershire
at about the beginning of the seventeenth century, and
proceeded so rapidly that nearly a hundred townships, mainly
situated in the south and west of the county, were enclosed
within about fifty years. Enclosure also began in Northamptonshire
about the same time, but at not so great a rate. The
author of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Considerations Concerning Common Fields and
Enclosures</span>,” published in 1653, makes a reference to
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Mr. Bentham’s<a lang="en" xml:lang="en" name="Anchor_95" id="Anchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> Christian Conflict</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 322</cite>), which gives
a list of eleven manors in Northamptonshire, enclosed and
depopulated. In a later sermon, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A Scripture Word against
Inclosures</span>,” 1656, John Moore says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">England (especially
Leicestershire and the counties round about) stands now as
guilty in the sight of God of the sinnes in the text. They sold
the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes, as
Israel did then</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1</cite>). A little later he again referred to
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Enclosure in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, and the
counties adjacent.</span>” This confirms the conclusion reached from
the other evidence that Leicestershire was in the centre of the
seventeenth-century movement of enclosure of common fields,
and that it was in Leicestershire that the movement was most
effective.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Rutland.</h4>

<p>Rutlandshire has had 46·5 per cent. of its area enclosed by
Acts of Parliament, 47,224 acres. Of this area 14,641 acres
were enclosed by Acts passed between 1756 and 1773; then for
twenty years there were no Acts, the next being passed in 1793.
By that and subsequent Acts 32,583 acres were enclosed.</p>

<p>John Crutchley, the Board of Agriculture reporter, says that
two-thirds of the country was enclosed, one-third unenclosed
(<cite>“Agriculture of Rutland, 1793,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30</cite>). As the area (32,583
acres) is just one-third of the total area of Rutlandshire (97,273
acres), Acts of Parliament entirely account for all the enclosure
since 1793. Of the area enclosed before 1793 there
remains about 50,000 acres, a little more than half the county,
unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Part at least must have been enclosed before the beginning of
the eighteenth century, for Celia Fiennes says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Rutlandshire
seems more woody and enclosed than some others</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 54</cite>). It
is one of the counties described by Walter Blyth as entirely
unenclosed in 1649; but, as we have seen, this description is
also applied by him to Leicestershire and Northamptonshire,
and as it was, especially in the case of the former county,
decidedly too sweeping, we cannot infer that no enclosure took
place in Rutlandshire before that date.</p>

<p>Leland passed through Uppingham and Stanford; he found
part of the county woody, but he makes no mention of enclosure.</p>

<p>He also gives a very full description of the counties of Leicester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and Northamptonshire. Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, and
Rockingham Forest in Northamptonshire, were then very extensive;
but all the remainder of the two counties he describes in
general as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaine</span>,” or by words which imply an unenclosed
condition. The only mention of enclosure is in the case
of two parks in Northamptonshire. (See <a href="#appendix_c" title="Go to Appendix C.">Appendix C</a>.)</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Warwick.</h4>

<p>Warwickshire is divided by the River Avon into two parts of
approximately equal area; the north-western part is a district of
ancient enclosure, probably enclosed in the main direct from
the forest state; the south-eastern part has a similar enclosure
history to Leicester and Northampton, except that its enclosure
took place generally somewhat earlier. One-quarter of the
whole county has undergone Parliamentary enclosure, but the
proportion so enclosed of the south-eastern part is much larger.</p>

<p>John Wedge, the Board of Agriculture reporter, estimates
that in 1793, out of a total area of 618,000 acres, 57,000 was
open field land (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 11</cite>). To reduce 618,000 to the true area of
the county (577,462 acres), one must deduct 10 per cent. A
deduction of 10 per cent. leaves about 51,000 acres of common
field. Enclosure Acts since account for 38,444 acres, and in
parishes not enclosed by Acts the tithe documents indicate
rather over 1000 acres of common field lands. There remains
a little over 10,000 acres unaccounted for, which has disappeared
between 1793 and the date of tithe commutation.</p>

<p>John Wedge appears to have attempted a list of open field
parishes with their area and extent of common field and waste,
but only got so far as to supply this information for five
parishes (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 54</cite>), each of which has undergone subsequent
enclosure by Act of Parliament. He draws attention to the
contrast between the two parts of Warwickshire: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>“About forty
years ago the southern and eastern parts of this county consisted
mostly of open fields. There are still about 50,000 acres
of open field land which in a few years will probably all be
enclosed. These lands, being now grazed, want much fewer
hands than they did in the former open state. Upon all
inclosures of open fields the farms have generally been made
much larger. For these causes the hardy yeomanry of country
villages have been driven for employment into Birmingham,
Coventry, and other manufacturing towns.”</p>

<p>About 90,000 acres was enclosed by Act of Parliament in
the part of Warwick described between 1743 and 1798. This,
together with the 50,000 acres remaining, amounts to rather
less than half the area of the division of the county under consideration.
As Wedge clearly was of opinion that the greater
part of <abbr title="South East">S.E.</abbr> Warwick was open at the date he mentions, and as
there is no reason for thinking he was wrong, it is to be inferred
that a considerable amount of non-Parliamentary enclosure
was going on in <abbr title="South East">S.E.</abbr> Warwick during the second half of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The extracts above given with reference to Leicester and
Northampton also prove that enclosure was going on in this
part of the county during the first half of the sixteenth century,
though it had so little advanced up to 1649 that Blyth speaks of
this part of the county as unenclosed.</p>

<p>Leland gives an extremely full account of the state of enclosure
of Warwickshire, which shows that as early as 1540 the north-west
part of the county was “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">much enclosed</span>.” It was on one
of his later journeys that he explored the county, entering from
Oxfordshire. He found, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Banbury to Warwick, twelve miles
by Champaine Groundes, fruitful of corne and grasse, and two
miles by some enclosed and woody groundes</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>, Part 2,
<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 162</cite>).</p>

<p>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I learned at Warwick that the most part of the shire of
Warwicke, that lyeth as Avon River descendeth on the right
hand or ripe of it, is in Arden (for soe is the ancient Name
of that part of the shire); and the ground in Arden is much
enclosed, plentifull of grasse, but not of corne. The other part
of Warwickshire that lyeth on the left hand or ripe of Avon
River, much to the south, is for the most part Champion, somewhat
barren of wood, but plentifull of corne</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 166 a</cite>).</p>

<p>We may add, so as to complete our review of the evidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
that William Marshall, in his book on the <cite>“Agriculture of the
Midland District of England” (1790)</cite>, treats a region of which
the town of Leicester was near the centre, comprising the
counties of Warwick, Rutland, the north of Leicester and of
Northampton, the east of Staffordshire, and the southern
extremities of Derby and Nottingham, as an agricultural unit.
He says: “Thirty years ago much of this district was in an
open state, and some townships still remain open; there are
others, however, which appear to have been long in a state of
enclosure, and in which, no doubt, the present system of
management originated” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8</cite>). This does not add to our
information about this district, but the fact that Marshall was
perfectly correct in his reading of the story told by the aspect
of the country is important, because for some other districts his
testimony is material.</p>

<p>To sum up, we find that in the north-west of Warwick
enclosure was general as early as 1540, while it was practically
non-existent in the south-east of that county and in
Leicester, Northampton and Rutland. We find that the movement
towards enclosure of the “champaine” country began
about the year 1600, that it proceeded steadily in spite of great
popular resistance through the seventeenth century, but at a
much greater rate in Leicester, and probably in <abbr title="South East">S.E.</abbr> Warwick,
than in Northamptonshire, the rate in Rutland being probably
slower than in Leicester, but certainly greater than in Northamptonshire,
the course of the movement being from west to
east; that about half of <abbr title="South East">S.E.</abbr> Warwick and of Leicester was
enclosed when the movement of Parliamentary enclosure began,
but less than half of Rutland, and not more than quarter
(probably not more than a fifth) of Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>We have seen that the enclosure of Bedford was later than
this, and we shall see that the same is true of Cambridgeshire
and Huntingdon. In the midlands of England the course of
enclosure from 1600 onwards was from west to east.</p>

<p>A word may be added with regard to the methods by which
non-Parliamentary enclosure was effected in this district. There
was great diversity in Leicestershire from village to village with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
regard to the diffusion of property, as may be seen from
Monk’s Appendix, in which he endeavours to give the
names of the principal owners in each “lordship.” Some
were entirely in the hands of a single individual, others had
many owners, but in the great majority the land was mainly,
but not entirely, owned by the lord of the manor. The description
of the enclosure of <abbr title="South East">S.E.</abbr> Warwick supplied by John Wedge,
the consolidation of farms, and the depopulation of the villages,
indicates that there enclosure, whether by Act of Parliament or
not, was carried through by the authority of the lord of the
manor, he being the main landowner.</p>

<p>The method by which this would be done when an Act
of Parliament was not resorted to is fully explained by
<cite>Edward Lawrence (“The Duty of a Steward to his Lord,
1727”), Article <abbr title="14">XIV.</abbr></cite></p>

<p>“A Steward should not forget to make the best Enquiry into
the disposition of any of the Freeholders within or near any of
his Lord’s Manors, to sell their Lands, that he may use his
best Endeavours to purchase them at as reasonable a price as
may be for his Lord’s Advantage and Convenience ...
especially in such Manors where improvements are to be made
by inclosing Commons and Common Fields; which (as every one,
who is acquainted with the late Improvements in Agriculture
must know) is not a little advantageous to the Nation in general,
as well as highly profitable to the Undertaker. If the Freeholders
cannot <em>all</em> be perswaded to sell, yet at least an Agreement
for Inclosing should be pushed forward, by the Steward, and a
scheme laid, wherein it may appear that an exact and proportional
share will be allotted to every proprietor; perswading them
first, if possible, to sign a Form of Agreement, and then to
chuse Commissioners on both sides.... If the Steward be a
Man of good sense, he will find a necessity of making use of it
all, in rooting out <em>superstition</em> from amongst them, as what is
so great a hindrance to all <em>noble</em> Improvements.” The superstition
referred to, is that enclosed land is cursed, and doomed
in three generations to pass out of the hands of the descendants
of the proprietor who enclosed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>That in the early seventeenth century much of the enclosure
was carried out by the power of the lord of the manor is plain
from the scraps of information given by John Moore. Thus he
tells us that Ashby Magna was enclosed in 1606, and that the
lord gave most of his tenants leases for three lives and twenty-one
years after (<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">“Scripture Word Against Inclosures,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9</cite>), that
being the reason why depopulation had not resulted up to 1656;
that in both Misterton and Poultney no house at all was left
except the minister’s, so that these two manors must have been
the property of absentee landlords.</p>

<p>But Catthorpe had no lord of the manor, it consisted of
580 acres divided among eight freeholders and five or six holders
of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">ancient cottages</span>” who were also Freeholders (Joseph Lee,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 5). The enclosure was carried out by the agreement of all
the owners, except one who objected on conscientious grounds.
The way in which these agreements to enclose were effected in
parishes where property was divided is thus described by Moore:&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">In
common fields they live like loving neighbours together for
the most part, till the <em>Spirit of Inclosure</em> enter into some rich
Churles heart, who doe not only pry out but feign occasions to
goe to law with their neighbours, and no reconcilement be made
till they consent to Inclosure. So this Inclosure makes thieves,
and then they cry out of thieves. Because they sold the
righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes. If it had
not been for two or three righteous in many Townes of these
Inland Counties, what desolation had there been made ere this
time?</span>” (<cite><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Scripture Word</span>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 12</cite>).</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Cambridge and Huntingdon.</h4>

<p>Much of these two counties anciently consisted of fen
and marsh, and of the land now cultivated a great deal
never passed through the common field system. But the
“upland” of each county was very late in undergoing
enclosure.</p>

<p>Vancouver, the reporter for Cambridgeshire, gives an estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of the areas of lands of different description, which I slightly
rearrange below.</p>

<p class="gap">The actual area of Cambridgeshire is 549,723 acres; but
Vancouver was an exact and careful observer, and the proportions
between the areas assigned to each description were no
doubt reasonably accurate. Here we find over two-thirds of the
total area unenclosed, and more than eight-ninths of the arable
land. It is, of course, possible, probable even, that a larger
amount than 15,000 acres of open field arable had undergone
enclosure, and that the 52,000 acres of improved pasture
includes a good deal of such land, laid down in grass on
enclosure. But even if we included the whole, there would only
be 67,000 acres of ancient common field arable which had
undergone enclosure, compared with 132,000 acres still open.</p>

<p>Vancouver also gives detailed accounts of ninety-eight of the
Cambridgeshire parishes, eighty-three of which were open,
fifteen enclosed. Of those which were open in 1793, seventy-four
have since been enclosed by Act of Parliament, nine have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
not, viz., Babraham, Boxworth, Downham, Ely, Littleport,
Lolworth, Madingley, Soham and Over.</p>

<p>Babraham had 1,350 acres of common field, and Vancouver
says that enclosure was desired. It was completely effected
before the date of tithe commutation.</p>

<p>Boxworth had 900 acres of common field. “The whole of
this parish,” says Vancouver, “lies within a ring fence and
containing 2,100 acres, is the property of one gentlemen.”
Vancouver’s acres, as we have seen, are large ones; the actual
area is 2,526 acres. Enclosure was effected before the date
of tithe commutation, and as might be supposed under the
circumstances, without an Act.</p>

<p>Downham had, according to Vancouver, 680 acres of common
field; the tithe map indicates 450 acres still remaining.</p>

<p>To Ely he assigns 2,100 acres of common field. This had all
gone at the time of tithe commutation.</p>

<p>Of 345 acres assigned to Littleport, a remnant of forty acres
survived to be recorded in the tithe map.</p>

<p>The common field land of Lolworth suffered no diminution;
for while Vancouver gives it 650 acres, the tithe map indicates
800 acres. They were enclosed at the time of the Crimean
war by common agreement of the owners, without an Act.
This was the last surviving common field parish in the vicinity.</p>

<p>In Soham enclosure was nearly as slow. Vancouver assigns
it 1,200 acres of common field; the tithe map 1,100 acres.</p>

<p>Madingley, Vancouver says, had 1,030 acres of common field.
These were all enclosed before the date of tithe commutation.</p>

<p>For Over the Board of Agriculture has no tithe documents;
but we may add that Horseheath had about 750 acres of common
field, out of a total of 1,850 acres, according to the tithe map.</p>

<p>Of the fifteen parishes stated by Vancouver to have been enclosed
before 1793, only two were enclosed by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>The extent of the information obtained from the Acts, the
tithe documents, and Vancouver’s report is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the 152 agricultural parishes of Cambridgeshire, we know
the date of enclosure of 118, enclosed by Acts of Parliament.
These are given in <a href="#appendix_b" title="Go to Appendix B.">Appendix B.</a></p>

Outwell, Tadlow, Tid <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles, Upwell-cum-Welney, and
Wisbeach <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, we know that they were enclosed without
Acts before 1793. The date 1790 is given for Chippingham, and
a small remnant of common field survived till 1851 in Newton.</p>

<p>Four parishes were enclosed, not by Acts, between 1793 and
the date of tithe commutation&mdash;Babraham, Boxworth, Ely and
Madingley.</p>

<p>Five parishes which were not entirely enclosed even at the
date of tithe commutation have not been enclosed by Act since.
These are Lolworth, which then had only about one-fifth of its
area enclosed; Horseheath, which was about half enclosed;
Soham, which had about 1,100 acres of common field and 456
acres of common, out of a total area of nearly 13,000 acres; and
Downham and Littleport, which had respectively 450 and forty
acres of common field remaining.</p>

<p>Of one parish, Over, we only know that it was open in 1793.</p>

Hatley, Papworth <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, Long Stanton, Westley Waterless,

<p>Celia Fiennes traversed the county. She describes the part
from Littlebery (in Essex) to Cambridge as entirely open (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48</cite>),
and makes no mention of enclosures in the description of the
view from the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Hogmogoge Hills</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>), but she speaks of
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">good enclosure</span>” between Cambridge and Huntingdon.</p>

<p>Though Cambridgeshire was on the whole so late in undergoing
enclosure, the conversion of arable into tillage had so far
proceeded that about one-fifth of the county was included in the
Inquisition of 1517, and it was found that in this part 1,422 acres
had been enclosed and converted into parks or pasture (<cite>Leadam,
“Domesday of Inclosures”)</cite>.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Huntingdon.</h4>

<p>George Maxwell, the Board of Agriculture reporter, says that
Huntingdon contains one hundred and six towns and hamlets,
of which forty-one were then (1793) wholly enclosed, and of the
remaining sixty-five a very considerable part was enclosed. He
computes that about a half of the “high land part” of the
county, which would, of course, include all old arable land,
was still unenclosed (<cite>“Agriculture of Huntingdon,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16</cite>).</p>

<p>Fifty-eight parishes were enclosed by Acts subsequently to
the date of his report, and one parish (Lutton) remained open to
the date of tithe commutation. This leaves six out of the sixty-five
open or partially enclosed parishes of his report, in which
enclosure was completed by the middle of the nineteenth
century without any Act.</p>

<p>Of the forty-one parishes wholly enclosed before 1793, twenty
were enclosed by Acts of Parliament, leaving twenty-one
parishes which might have been enclosed contemporaneously
without Acts, or to be assigned to the time previous to the
beginning of Parliamentary enclosure.</p>

<p>Some of this enclosure is certainly to be assigned to an early
date. Celia Fiennes, as we have seen, found more enclosure as
she came to Huntingdon from Cambridge. Leland also found
enclosure in the smaller county.</p>

<p>The story of the enclosure of Essex and Suffolk is almost
completely told by the map. Each is sharply divided into a
larger part very anciently enclosed, without Acts of Parliament,
and a smaller part close to the boundaries of Hertford,
Cambridge, and Norfolk, which was enclosed at a late date
by Acts of Parliament. Essex has but one Act belonging to
the eighteenth century, and that is dated as late as 1795.
Suffolk has nine Acts belonging to the eighteenth, and forty-four
belonging to the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The additional information available only serves to bring out
more clearly the very striking contrast between the regions of
ancient and recent enclosure.</p>

<p>On the one hand we find that the Parliamentary enclosure of
the extreme west and north-west portion of Essex is only part
of the recent enclosure of that part.</p>

<p>The Enclosure Acts cover twenty-nine parishes, and an area
of 22,000 acres, about 760 acres per parish. Vancouver, who
reported on Essex, as well as Cambridge, tells us, “The arable
land in about forty parishes lies very much in open common
fields, and which in point of quantity is found to average
1,200 acres per parish.”<a name="Anchor_96" id="Anchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> He gives a list of open field parishes;
Thraxted and Streethall, which have not since been enclosed
by Act, are included; and each of those had some common
field at the time of tithe commutation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he tells us that the neighbourhood of
Great Dunmow, which is quite close to the region of nineteenth
century enclosure, had been enclosed from time immemorial.<a name="Anchor_97" id="Anchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a></p>

<p>The well-known passage in the “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Discourse of the Commonweal</cite>,”
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Countries wheare most Inclosures be, are most wealthie,
as essex, kent, devenshire, and such,”</span> sufficiently establishes the
ancient enclosure of the greater part of Essex. And though the
evidence is not very full, it is, I think, sufficient to show that
the enclosure of the corresponding part of Suffolk had a similar
history. Celia Fiennes says that the journey from Ipswich to
Woodbridge is “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">7 miles mostly Lanes, Enclosed countrys</span>”;
and from Woodbridge to Saxmundham “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The wayes are pretty
deep, mostly Lanes, very little Commons</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107</cite>).</p>

<p><cite>John Norden (1602)</cite> also makes mention of Suffolk methods
of hedging.</p>

<p>The question then arises with regard to this region of ancient
enclosure in Essex and Suffolk, whether it ever passed through
the typical English common field system. To this question we
are able to give an unhesitating answer.</p>

<p>In Suffolk, far away from any other Parliamentary enclosure, in
the south-east corner of the county are the parishes of Orford and
Iken. The enclosure at Orford was in 1881. There were but
forty-six acres to enclose, and these lay in strips alternately
belonging to the lord of the manor and to the Corporation of
Orford. The existence of corporate property in this small spot
of land preserved it from enclosure to such a late date.</p>

<p>The case of Iken appears to have been somewhat similar. It
was enclosed in 1804. There was only the small area of 100 acres
to enclose, comprising “certain open and common fields, meadows,
commonable lands, and waste grounds.” The Marquis of
Hertford was lord of the manor, and six individuals by name,
and “divers others” are said to be the other proprietors of
land. There is a special clause authorising the parish
authorities, if they will, to accept rents from the Marquis of
Hertford in lieu of allotments, so there must have been corporate
property in the commonable lands, and this no doubt
accounted for the survival of this small area of common field.</p>

<p>But the clearest evidence is from the town of Colchester. The
borough is of great extent, and includes the four agricultural
parishes of Greenstead, Bere Church, or West Donyland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Lexden and Mile End. In these four parishes, says Vancouver,
“one-third of the arable land lies in half-yearly common fields”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40</cite>). The Corporation of Colchester is to this day a very
large owner of arable land; how it was enclosed, and how the
Corporation, as distinct from the free-men, secured the property
after the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, I do
not know. The important point is conveyed in the word “half-yearly.”
The arable fields of Colchester were genuine common
fields, subject to rights of common of pasture after harvest.</p>

<p>I think there can be little doubt that though much of Essex
and Suffolk might have been ancient woodland, and have been
enclosed directly from that condition, the primitive village community
of Essex was approximately of the same type as that of
central England.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Norfolk.</h4>

<p>Adequate material does not exist for a statistical survey of
the enclosure of Norfolk, because of the disappointing habit
which the promoters of Enclosure Acts for this county fell
into about the year 1793,<a name="Anchor_98" id="Anchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> and persisted in later, of not making
any statement with regard to the area covered by the Act.
The best statement that we can make is that 297 parishes
out of 682 were enclosed by Act of Parliament.<a name="Anchor_99" id="Anchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98" href="#Anchor_98" title="Return to text.">[98]</a> Before 1793 thirty-one parishes were enclosed by twenty-two Acts, the area
covered by nineteen of which is stated, amounting altogether to 50,187 acres.
The total area so enclosed was probably not less than 54,000 acres.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99" href="#Anchor_99" title="Return to text.">[99]</a> There were also eighty Enclosure Acts for the enclosure of common waste
or pasture merely. In these also the area is stated for a small minority only.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>We have already dealt with some peculiar features of Norfolk
agriculture revealed by preambles of Enclosure Acts. The chief
other fact which is striking in its enclosure history is that the
county is divided by the chalk ridge, which passes through the
centre of the county, from north to south, and which reaches the
coast at Cromer, into two parts of approximately equal area.
The patches of colour which indicate enclosure by Act of Parliament
are scattered indifferently over the whole map of the
county; but the significance of the colour varies. East Norfolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
has all the aspect of a country of very early enclosure. The
fields are small, the hedges are big and high, like Devonshire
hedges, the roads are narrow and winding. The aspect recalls
Kent’s previously quoted words. “There is a considerable
deal of common field land in Norfolk, though a much smaller
proportion than in many other counties; for notwithstanding
common rights for great cattle exist in all of them, and even
sheepwalk privileges in many, yet the natural industry of the
people is such, that whenever a person can get 5 or 6 acres together,
he plants a white-thorn edge round it, and sets an oak at every
rod distance, which is consented to by a kind of general courtesy
from one neighbour to another” (<cite>“Agriculture of Norfolk,”
1st Edition, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 22</cite>). The Parliamentary enclosure which took
place in a parish where the neighbours had been showing this
courtesy to one another consisted mainly in the extinction of
common rights over enclosed land.</p>

<p>The making of hedges had proceeded to such an extent in
East Norfolk by the end of the seventeenth century, that
an anonymous author who brought out an annotated edition of
Tusser’s “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Five hundred points of Husbandry</cite>,” and “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Champion
and Severall</cite>,” under the title “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tusser Redivivus</cite>,” in the year
1710, explains the term “woodland” (a term which Tusser
really used as a synonym for “several” or enclosed land) to
mean East Norfolk, saying that this district was so much
enclosed in small fields with fine trees in the hedges, that it
was known as “the Woodlands.”</p>

<p>At this time the western half of the county was still almost
entirely open. Arthur Young wrote in 1771, “From forty to
sixty years ago, all the Northern and Western and a part of the
Eastern tracts of the county were sheepwalks, let so low as from
<abbr title="6 pence">6<i>d.</i></abbr> to <abbr title="1 shilling and 6 pence">1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></abbr> and <abbr title="2 shillings">2<i>s.</i></abbr> an acre. Much of it was in this
condition only thirty years ago. The great improvements have
been made by reason of the following circumstances:</p>

<p>(1) By enclosing without the assistance of Parliament.</p>

<p>(2) By a spirited use of marle and clay.</p>

<p>(3) By the introduction of an excellent course of crops.</p>

<p>(4) The cultivation of hand hoed turnips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>(5) Clover and ray grass.</p>

<p>(6) Long leases.</p>

<p>(7) By the county being divided chiefly into large farms.</p>

<p>“Parliamentary inclosures are scarcely ever so complete
and general as” (non-Parliamentary enclosure) “in Norfolk”
(<cite>“Eastern Tour,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 150</cite>).</p>

<p>William Marshall supplies a confirmatory note. “Norfolk, it
is probable (speaking generally of the county), has not borne
grain, in abundance, much above a century. During the passed
century” (the eighteenth) “a principal part of it was <em>fresh land</em>,
a newly discovered country in regard to grain crops” (<cite>“Review
of the Reports to the Board of Agriculture for the Eastern
Department,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 314</cite>).</p>

<p>Enclosure in the western half of Norfolk and along the
central chalk ridge in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
whether common field arable were included or not, meant the
reverse of what it had meant in the first half of the sixteenth
century&mdash;the conversion of land from sheeprun to arable land
and to highly cultivated land. Kent, in a second edition of his
report of Norfolk, published in 1796, estimated that two-thirds
of the whole area of the county was then arable; and of the
arable land three-quarters was enclosed, one-quarter in common
field. In other words, one-half of the area of the county was
enclosed arable, one-sixth common field arable. The remainder
he describes as follows:</p>

<table class="w_norfolk" summary="West Norfolk enclosure">

<p class="noindent">with small areas for woods, plantations, roads, lakes, rivers, and
swamps. Whatever ancient common field arable had been
enclosed before the beginning of the eighteenth century and
converted into pasture, was apparently re-converted into arable
before the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<h3 title="">THE SOUTHERN MIDLANDS.</h3>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Middlesex.</h4>

<p>I have found very little information with regard to the
enclosure of Middlesex beyond that obtained from the Enclosure
Acts. It is remarkable that these should cover so large a part
(19·7 per cent.) of the area of the county.</p>

<p>Of twenty-six Acts, covering 35,757 acres, twenty-three,
covering 30,000 acres, belong to the period after 1793. The
Board of Agriculture reporters, Thomas Baird and Peter Foot,
tell us respectively (1) that there were about 50,000 acres under
tillage in 1793 (<cite><a id="agr_middlesex">“Agriculture of Middlesex,”</a> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7</cite>), and (2) “The
Common Fields in the county of Middlesex, which are at present
in a good course of husbandry, form a large proportion as to the
number of acres when compared to the cultivated enclosures”
(<cite><i><a href="#agr_middlesex" title="Go to previous citation.">Ibid.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 72</cite>).</p>

<p>That the common fields were “in a good course of husbandry”
very probably means that the exercise of common rights had
been largely restricted, and it is not improbable that while some
of the ancient common fields of Middlesex became converted into
small dairy farms, others became market gardens by means of
a very moderate amount of interchanging of properties and
holdings.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Hertfordshire.</h4>

<p>The county of Hertford is rather remarkable for the extent of
open field land (common rights have so far decayed that one can
hardly call it common field) persisting to the present day.
Notes have already been given on Hitchin, Bygrave, Clothall,
and Wallington. There were further no less than seventeen
enclosures under the Act of 1845, a number only surpassed by
Oxfordshire, and in a number of other parishes small remnants
of common fields are indicated by the tithe maps.</p>

<p>But on the whole Hertfordshire was a county of early
enclosure. When the Board of Agriculture survey was made
only four parishes and a part of Hitchin had undergone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Parliamentary enclosure; but the reporter says, “There are
several small common fields in this county, but these are mostly
by agreement among the owners and occupiers cultivated nearly
in the same way as in the enclosed state” (<cite>D. Walker,
“Agriculture of Hertfordshire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>).</p>

<p>Walter Blyth in 1649 included “Hartford” with “Essex,
Kent, Surrey, Sussex,” etc., as enclosed counties (<cite>“The
English Improver,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>).</p>

<p>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">An insurrection in hertfordshire for the comens at Northall
and Cheshunt</span>,” was, according to Hales, the first beginning of
the enclosure riots and rebellions in the reign of Edward <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr></p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that Hertford was in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries so much more enclosed than the
surrounding counties, than Middlesex as well as than Bedford
and Cambridge, and even more enclosed than the part of Essex
immediately adjoining.</p>

<p>Leland gives no account of the condition of the county with
regard to enclosure; but as no earlier author than Blyth speaks
of Hertford as an enclosed county, I am inclined to believe that
its enclosure mainly took place in the sixteenth and in the first
half of the seventeenth century. It is to be noticed that
Hertford was excluded from the operation of the last
(<cite>39 Elizabeth, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2</cite>) of the Depopulation Acts, requiring that
all old arable land should continue under tillage and be
cultivated according to the local custom.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Buckingham.</h4>

<p>Buckingham is, on the whole, a county of late enclosure. A
large proportion (34·2 per cent.) of the area was enclosed by
Acts of Parliament; two-thirds of this enclosure belonging to
the eighteenth and one-third to the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The reporters to the Board of Agriculture, William James and
Jacob Malcolm, supply a list of the parishes containing common
fields in 1794, with an approximate statement of the area. The
majority of these parishes have, of course, undergone Parliamentary
enclosure since. By comparing their list with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the Enclosure Acts and with the summary of the tithe documents,
we find that the following seventeen parishes were enclosed
without Acts between 1794 and the date of tithe commutation:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Astwood</li>
  <li>Buckland</li>
  <li>Dinton</li>
  <li>Drayton Beauchamp</li>

  <li>Great Missenden</li>
  <li>Little Missenden</li>
  <li>Newton Longueville</li>
  <li>Quainton</li>
</ul>

<p>The following five still had remains of common field at the
time of tithe commutation, though the area was considerably
reduced in each case:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap">As so much gradual non-Parliamentary enclosure took place
during the nineteenth century, it is to be supposed that the
same process was also going on right through the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>Buckingham is traversed by the Chiltern Hills, and so is
divided into two distinct regions. About half the county lies
north-west of the Chilterns, on a sub-cretaceous formation, like
Bedfordshire, with fertile soil, and villages thickly scattered.
The remainder consists of the chalky downs and the later
formations, like most of Hertfordshire and Middlesex.</p>

<p>The enclosure of the south-east portion was earlier than that
of the north-west part. Arthur Young in 1771 was much struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
by the extent of the open fields in the latter part. The vale of
Aylesbury,<a name="Anchor_100" id="Anchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a> he says, was good clay, and open field (<cite>“Eastern
Tour,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18</cite>). From Aylesbury to Buckingham “nearly the
whole country is open field, the soil among the richest I ever
saw, black putrid clay” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19</cite>). “As for the landlords, what
in the name of wonder is the reason of their not enclosing! All
this vale would make as fine meadows as any in the world”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</cite>). However, about Hockston (Hoggeston) he saw many
new enclosures (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 24</cite>). Hoggeston itself was never enclosed by
Act, but several neighbouring villages had been enclosed by
Acts passed previously to 1771.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_100" id="Footnote_100" href="#Anchor_100" title="Return to text.">[100]</a> An Act for the enclosure of the common field land of Aylesbury itself was
passed in the same year.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Celia Fiennes passed through the same part of Buckinghamshire
about eighty years before. From Stony Stratford to Great
Horwood, she says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">this country is fruitfull, full of woods,
Enclosures, and rich Ground. The little towns stand pretty
thicke. You have many in view</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 97</cite>). This does not imply
anything more than very partial enclosure; for Celia Fiennes,
accustomed to the complete absence of hedges of her own part
of Wiltshire, always notices enclosure rather than the absence
of enclosure. That many little towns should be in sight of one
passing through a flat country implies that it is open, except
close to the villages.</p>

<p>Leland, in 1536, came from Bedfordshire along the boundary
between Herts and Bucks and into the extreme south of
Buckinghamshire, and found that enclosures had already begun.
He describes the whole county in one luminous sentence,
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Looke as the countrye of the Vale of Alesbury for the most
part is clean barren of wood, and is champaine, soe is all the
Chilterne well woodid and full of Enclosures</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 192 a</cite>).</p>

<p>It seems quite clear, then, that the enclosure movement of the
south-east of Berkshire was ancient; that it moved up the long
slope of the Chilterns from the Thames and Middlesex, but
stopped at the open chalk downs which marked the summit of
the range; and that the movement which affected the enclosure
of the Vale of Aylesbury and all north-western Buckinghamshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>was part of the general enclosure movement of the Midlands,
spreading southwards from Leicester and Northampton, as we
have seen it spread eastwards.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Oxford.</h4>

<p>Oxfordshire may be termed a sister county to Buckinghamshire;
but by far the greater part of the county lies north-west
of the Chiltern Hills, which occupy the south east extremity.
We find, as we should expect, that the history of the enclosure
of Oxfordshire resembles that of Bedfordshire and of North-West
Buckinghamshire; 45·6 per cent. of the area of Oxfordshire
underwent Parliamentary enclosure compared with 46·0
per cent. of Bedfordshire and 34·2 per cent. of Bucks; in
Oxford about 62 per cent. of the total Parliamentary enclosure
belonged to the eighteenth century, in Bedford 54 per cent., in
Buckinghamshire 66 per cent. Oxford, however, is remarkable
for the extent of the enclosure (eighteen Acts enclosing 23,578
acres) under the General Enclosure Act of 1845.</p>

<p>Richard Davis, the Board of Agriculture reporter, while he gives
a very full statement of the methods of cultivating the common
fields of the county, makes no statement with regard to their extent.</p>

<p>As in Buckinghamshire, partial enclosure, particularly in
the immediate neighbourhood of the villages, had taken place
before the eighteenth century. Celia Fiennes found “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Oxford
Environ’d round with woods and Enclosure, yet not so neare as to
annoy the town which stands pleasant and Compact</span>,” and from
the Malvern Hills she says “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Oxford, Gloucestershire, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
appears in plaines, enclosures, woods and rivers and many great
hills</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 33</cite>). By “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">plaines</span>” stretches of common fields are
to be understood.</p>

<p>Leland found no enclosure in Oxfordshire in any part he
visited.</p>

<h3 title="">THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Lincoln.</h4>

<p>Lincoln and the East Riding of Yorkshire have a similar
enclosure history. Each was largely enclosed by Acts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>Parliament; in each nearly four-fifths of the Parliamentary
enclosure was effected in the eighteenth century; in each
enclosure was not marked either by a general conversion of arable
into pasture, as in Leicestershire, or by a general conversion of
pasture into arable, as in Norfolk; in both a considerable proportion
of the common-field land before enclosure was worked
on the two-field system. As much as 40·1 per cent. of the
East Riding of Yorkshire is covered by the Acts for enclosing
common-field parishes, and 29·3 per cent. of Lincolnshire; but
for the latter county there are also Acts for enclosing great
extents of commonable marshes; and including these and other
Acts for enclosing commons and wastes, about 35 per cent. of
Lincolnshire has undergone Parliamentary enclosure.</p>

<p>A good deal of non-Parliamentary enclosure took place during
the nineteenth century. Thomas Stone, the Board of Agriculture
reporter, estimates that there were in 1793, 200,000
acres of commons, wastes, and unimbanked salt marshes, and
268,000 acres of common fields. He over-estimates the total
area of the county so much, that to rectify his figures we have to
deduct 10 per cent.&mdash;this leaves 421,000 acres of common fields
and other commonable lands. There have been enclosed by
Parliamentary action since 207,659 acres by Acts for enclosing
common-field parishes, and about 74,000 acres by Acts for
enclosing other commonable lands; if we suppose there are
12,000 acres of common fields and commons surviving, this
accounts for 293,659 acres, and leaves about 127,000 acres
unaccounted for&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, enclosed by non-Parliamentary process
during the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>If the same proportion between the scope of the two methods
be supposed to have held good during the earlier part of the
period of Parliamentary enclosure, it would follow that at the
beginning of that period (1730) Lincolnshire was about half
enclosed and half open.</p>

<p>From the references to Lincolnshire by our tourists, one
would expect to find a less degree of enclosure. Arthur
Young, in 1768, that is, after fifty-three Enclosure Acts for
Lincolnshire had been passed, found the country from Stamford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>to Grimsthorpe mostly open (<cite>“Northern Tour,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 77</cite>), from
Grimsthorpe to Colsterworth chiefly open, Colsterworth to
Grantham, enclosed on the right hand, open on the left (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84</cite>),
and from Grantham to Newark all open (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 94</cite>). Celia Fiennes,
about 1695, following the same road, found no enclosures but a
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">fine champion country</span>.” Leland gives the same testimony.</p>

<p>By comparing Celia Fiennes with Arthur Young, we have
evidence of enclosure proceeding in the south-west of Lincolnshire
between 1695 and 1768, which is partly, but not entirely,
accounted for by Parliamentary enclosure. The three descriptions
give the impression that up to the beginning of Parliamentary
enclosure Lincolnshire was much less than half
enclosed. It is, however, not difficult to reconcile this with the
conclusion inferred from Thomas Stone’s statement and the
Enclosure Acts; for none of the three travellers touched more than
the western part of the county. No doubt the eastern part was
earlier enclosed. This is, indeed, indicated by the distribution
of Parliamentary enclosure, as shown by the map.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">The East Riding of Yorkshire.</h4>

<p>We have no estimate of the extent of common-field land in
the East Riding from the Board of Agriculture reporter; but
Arthur Young, in his “Northern Tour,” describes the part
betwene Sheffield and Goole and the East Riding as about half
open and half enclosed (<cite><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 172–210</cite>). He further says (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 178</cite>)
that in the East Riding “Inclosures and turnpikes were carried on
with great spirit during the late war” (<i>i.e.</i>, “The Seven Years’
War”). Nine Acts were passed for the enclosure of eleven
parishes during that war; but this can only have been a part of
the spirited proceedings.</p>

<p>As in the case of Bedfordshire, when we allow for marshes
along the Humber, and hill country on the Wolds, which never
passed through the common-field system, for the indubitable
non-Parliamentary enclosure proceeding side by side with Parliamentary
enclosure, and particularly for the active enclosure
spoken of by Arthur Young in the middle of the eighteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>century, there remains but little enclosure of common fields to
be attributed to earlier centuries. Some such enclosure must
be assigned to the sixteenth century. The Commission of 1517
inquired into nearly the whole riding and found 1560 acres of
arable land enclosed, 1545 acres of which were laid down to
grass (<cite>W. S. Leadam, “The Domesday of Inclosure”</cite>).</p>

<p>Leland also found some enclosure in the East Riding, which
he traversed pretty completely. (<i>See</i> Appendix C.)</p>

<p>We have mention of a park and of enclosed land in four
different places, though in each of the four only for about a mile
of the route.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">The North and West Ridings.</h4>

<p>The North and West Ridings of Yorkshire were much earlier
enclosed than the East Riding. This is the natural consequence
of the fact that in early times they possessed a much smaller
proportion of arable land, and, as I have shown in a previous
chapter, the more pasture predominates, the less the common-field
arable is able to resist the tendency to enclosure. The
difference between the proportions of the three ridings covered
by Enclosure Acts, by which common fields were enclosed is
striking: East Riding 40·1 per cent., West Riding 11·6, North
Riding 6·3. But this understates the case, for I include all
Acts whereby any arable common field at all is enclosed, and in
the North and West Ridings many of these Acts are for the
enclosure of a great stretch of moor and a mere remnant of
common field, and these unduly swell the total. Examples are
an Act in 1791 for the enclosure of 6000 acres of common, and
30 acres of “mesne inclosures,” <i>i.e.</i>, of intermixed tilled land
which is separated from the surrounding common pasture by a
hedge; an Act in 1801 for the enclosure of 150 acres of common
field and common meadow, and 4000 acres of common pasture
at Kettlewell and Conistree; an Act in 1815 for the enclosure
of a wretched remnant of nine acres of common field arable, and
6330 acres of common. The existence of such remnants of
common field arable bears witness to the gradual enclosure
which would have entirely extinguished them a little later, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>the opportunity of the enclosure of the commons had not been
seized to bring them also within the scope of the Acts.</p>

<p>William Marshall’s account of the enclosure of the Vale of
Pickering has already been given. Arthur Young in 1768
describes the view from the road from Kirby Moorside to Cleveland
as one of “extensive valleys cut into innumerable inclosures”
(<cite>“Northern Tour,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 93</cite>). Enclosure was the rule
all the way from Driffield northwards.</p>

<p>Celia Fiennes kept more to the West Riding. From Darlington
to Richmond, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I went through Lanes and Woods, an
Enclosed country</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 183</cite>). Richmond to Boroughbridge was
for 3 or 4 miles through narrow lanes, then for 5 or 6
through common (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 184</cite>). From Knaresborough to Leeds
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">it was much in Lanes and uphills and Downhills, some little
part was open common</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 184</cite>). From Leeds to Eland
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">much in enclosures</span>” (<cite><a id="fiennes_p185"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 185</a></cite>). About Eland “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">all the hills
full of inclosures</span>” (<cite><i><a href="#fiennes_p185" title="Go to previous citation.">ibid.</a></i></cite>). From Eland to Blackstone Edge, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">these
parts have some resemblance to Darbyshire, only here are more
woody places and inclosure</span>s” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 186</cite>).</p>

<p>The earlier history of the enclosure of most of the West
Riding and North Riding is summed up in the passage from
Walter Blyth:&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Woodlands wont before inclosure to be
relieved by the Champion, and now become gallant corn
countries.... West of Warwick, North of Worcester, Staffordshire,
Shropshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and all the Countries
thereabouts</span>” (<cite>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">English Improver</span>,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40</cite>). For while Celia
Fiennes found so much enclosure, Leland found chiefly moor
and forest, yet more enclosure than “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Chaumpaine</span>.”</p>

<p>The great contrast between the description given by Celia
Fiennes and that given by Leland sufficiently confirms the
statement of Walter Blyth, which we may amplify as follows:&mdash;Enclosure
made little progress in Yorkshire before the middle
of the sixteenth century, but thenceforward it was pushed
steadily on mainly by the tilling and enclosing of common
wastes and pastures, and the clearing and cultivation of forests
in the North and West Riding, and the common-field arable
also underwent division and gradual enclosure. That the Vale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>of Pickering in the North Riding and the district between
Sheffield and Goole in the West Riding, being the parts where
arable common fields most predominated, were the last of the
cultivated districts to be enclosed; the Vale of Pickering
being mainly enclosed by non-Parliamentary means in the
first half of the eighteenth century; the South Yorkshire
district being largely enclosed by Acts of Parliament in the
second half of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Lastly attention must be drawn to the great number of Acts
of Enclosure for Yorkshire enclosing common pasture or waste
only.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Nottinghamshire.</h4>

<p>Nottinghamshire may be said to consist of an ancient “champain”
district, which has an enclosure history exactly similar
to that of the neighbouring districts of Northamptonshire and
Lincolnshire, and an ancient forest district.</p>

<p>The county as a whole has a percentage of Parliamentary
enclosure, 32·5, which must be considered high when allowance
is made for the fact that so much land must have been enclosed
directly from the forest state without passing through the
common-field system. The two surviving examples of common-field
parishes, Laxton and Eakring, have been before described;
Bole also was till recently unenclosed.</p>

<p>The Board of Agriculture reporter, Robert Lowe, attempted
to give an account of the state of enclosure of the different
parishes in 1793, but evidently found it beyond his powers to
make the lists at all complete. But his list of unenclosed
parishes enables us to give the following nine parishes as
enclosed without Parliamentary intervention since 1793:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Askham</li>
  <li>Kirklington</li>
  <li>Rampton</li>
  <li>Saundby</li>
  <li>Treswell</li>
  <li>North Wheatley</li>
  <li>South Wheatley</li>
  <li>Kneesall</li>
  <li>Widnerpool</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">together with the hamlets of Ompton and Clipston.</p>

<p>And his list of recently-enclosed parishes enables us to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>the following nine parishes as enclosed without Parliamentary
sanction shortly before 1793:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bingham</li>
  <li>Carcolston</li>
  <li>Selston</li>
  <li>Shelton</li>
  <li>Cotham</li>
  <li>Kneeton</li>
  <li>Orston</li>
  <li>Sibthorpe</li>
  <li>Thoroton</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">together with the hamlets of Aslacton, Newton, Oldwork, and
Cropwell Butler.</p>

<p>All these had been enclosed, he says, within the previous
twenty years.</p>

<p>The fact that the extent of non-Parliamentary enclosure in
<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Notts.</abbr>, in the period from 1773 to 1793 is just equal, according
to this, to that of the non-Parliamentary enclosure after 1793,
is a slight clue to the probable extent of non-Parliamentary
enclosure in the eighteenth century in other counties similarly
circumstanced.</p>

<p>We should expect, then, to find the part of the county which
was anciently tilled, practically entirely open, at the beginning
of the eighteenth century. This is confirmed by the evidence,
so far as it goes. Celia Fiennes says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">From Nottingham
Castle I saw a prospect more than 20 mile about. The land is
very rich and fruitfull, so the Green meadows with the fine corn
ffields which seemes to bring forth in handfulls. They soe most
of Barley and have great encrease, there is all sorts of Graine
besides, and plaines and Rivers and Great woods and Little Towns
all in view</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56</cite>).</p>

<p>Leland was similarly struck with South Nottingham. Coming
south from Rotherham he found “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">very woody Grounde</span>,” then
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">hethy</span>,” then “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Corny and Paster</span>,” then “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Ground very fruteful
of Corne</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="5">V.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 91, 92</cite>). But when he got past
Nottingham the view made him burst into Latin. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">After that
I cam a little beyond Trent I saw all Champaine Grounde
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">undecunque</span> within sight, and very little wood but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">infinita
frugum copia</span>.</span>”</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Derby.</h4>

<p>The enclosure history of Derbyshire closely resembles that
of the West Riding of Yorkshire. A somewhat larger part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>(16·5 per cent.) of it underwent enclosure by Acts for the
enclosure of common-field arable in conjunction with other
commonable land, and about 5 per cent. more by Acts for the
enclosure of common pasture and waste. The common-field
arable is frequently called “mesne inclosures” (sometimes
“mesne field”), showing that the idea of a hedge was that it
surrounded the corn crops to keep out beasts, not the pasture
to keep them in. Celia Fiennes gives a general description of
the county: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">You see neither hedge nor tree but only low
drye stone walls round some ground, Else its only hills and dales
as thick as you Can Imagine</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 77</cite>). “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">All Darbyshire is but
a world of peaked hills.</span>”</p>

<p>It will be remembered that it had by 1649, according to Blyth,
become a gallant corn country through enclosure. Leland
passed it by.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Durham.</h4>

<p>The history of the enclosure of Durham is told by the Board
of Agriculture reporter in a sentence: “In this county the
lands, or common fields of townships, were for the most part
inclosed soon after the Restoration.... The common fields
are few in number and of small extent” (<cite>Joseph Granger,
“Agriculture of Durham,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 43</cite>).</p>

<p>All other evidence simply confirms this statement. The
Enclosure Acts for enclosing common fields are but five in
number, and the most extensive of them covers only 800 acres,
of which part only is common field. (The Enclosure Acts of
the other type are numerous in comparison and extensive in
scope, one covering 10,000, one 20,000, one 25,000 and one
28,000 acres).</p>

<p>The statement, too, is confirmed by two contemporary authors,
previously quoted, and by the records of Leland and Celia
Fiennes. Celia Fiennes says that from Newcastle to Durham
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the whole county looks like a fruitful woody place</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 178</cite>),
and she compares it to the neighbourhood of Blackheath (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 179</cite>),
from which we must infer some open common, but all the
cultivated land in a state of enclosure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>
<p>Leland traversed the whole county but found no enclosure. Nor
does he describe any part of the county as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaine</span>” but
merely as good corn, or grass, or moor, or mountain. It is, I
think, safe to conclude that there were no extensive stretches
of common-field arable within view; but also, one is inclined
to infer that enclosure had not yet begun.</p>

<p>Further, there is an illuminating note from Arthur Young
(1768): “Farms become large on entering Northumberland,
after the small ones of Yorkshire and Durham” (<cite>“Northern
Tour,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61</cite>).</p>

<p>It has to be borne in mind that the disorder on the Border
checked the development of agriculture till the accession of
James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, probably at least as far south as the North Riding
of Yorkshire. With the gradual increase of population, and
improvement of roads, cultivation spread over the wastes; first
in Yorkshire, then in Durham, then in Northumberland. At
first the agent was a peasant, carving a small farm for his own
maintenance, later a landlord or farmer able to employ labourers
and work a large farm.</p>

<p>That the enclosure of Northumberland took place later than
that of Durham, and was the work of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, is on <i>a priori</i> grounds probable, and is further
indicated by the fact that Celia Fiennes makes no mention of
enclosure in her account of her ride from the Scottish border into
Durham. A further reference to the enclosure of Northumberland
will be made when we come to Cumberland.</p>

<h3 title="">THE SOUTH-EAST OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Kent.</h4>

<p>Kent is certainly a county of very ancient enclosure. This is
clearly indicated by the fact that not a single Act for the enclosure
of common field has been passed by the whole county. It is
also witnessed by a whole series of writers, from Boys, the
Board of Agriculture reporter, who says, “There are no
Common Fields in Kent,”<a name="Anchor_101" id="Anchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> to the author of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Discourse of the Commonweal</span>,” “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">those counties which be most enclosed,
as essex, kent, devenshire</span>.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101" href="#Anchor_101" title="Return to text.">[101]</a> <cite>“Agriculture of Kent” (1796), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 44</cite>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>But in Kent it would appear that if some investigator as
careful as Vancouver had at a somewhat earlier date reported
on the agriculture of Kent, he would have found some remains
of arable common fields in the far eastern corner of the county.
William Lambarde, in the “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Perambulation of Kent</cite>,” 1570,
says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The soile is for the most part bountifull, consisting
indifferently of arable, pasture, meadow and woodland. Howbeit
of these wood occupieth the greatest portion even to this day
except it be towards the east, which coast is more champaigne
than the residue</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 3</cite>).</p>

<p>More than a hundred years later, Celia Fiennes says:
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Canterbury to Dover was a good road and a sort of Champion
Country</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103</cite>). It was open, it was mainly arable land,
but it differed in some respect from the Champain of the
Midlands; and again, a hundred years later, William Marshall
writes in 1798 of the Isle of Thanet: “The whole country
lies open, excepting in the immediate environs of villages....
The present productions, if we cut off the marsh lands, may be
said to be arable crops” (<cite>“Southern District,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 6</cite>).</p>

<p>This was written, it will be noticed, just after Boys had
written his statement that there were no common fields in
Kent. We can reconcile the two statements if we suppose
that by the disuse of rights of common, and by the consolidation
of scattered properties and holdings by mutual exchanges, the
characteristics of common field had been abolished, while in
consequence of there never having arisen any tendency to
convert the arable land into pasture, no necessity for the
expensive labour of making hedges arose. But I have no
evidence to show at what date the open arable land ceased to
be common field.</p>

<p>The question arises whether the common-field system of the
ordinary English type ever existed in this part of Kent; and
here again there is no decisive evidence that I know of by which
to answer the question. The fact that the similar question for
Essex is answered in the affirmative by the Colchester common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>fields perhaps counts for something; and that the Surrey
common fields come at Croydon close to the county boundary,
for a little more. At Eltham there is an old charity called the
Fifteen Penny Lands; only a few acres remain in the form of
land, the rest having been sold and the proceeds invested; but
there still remains an acre described as “Land in East Field,
Dockland’s Shot.” In 1578 a member of the Roper family,
perhaps Margaret Roper, the daughter of Sir Thomas More, or
her husband, bequeathed to Eltham “a parcel of ground containing
by estimation four acres, in the common field, called
East Field.”<a name="Anchor_102" id="Anchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a> Eltham was a royal manor, hence likely to
preserve old customs to a later date than other manors, and the
arrangement of ancient common fields, particularly towards
Eltham Common, seems clearly traceable. In Addington, an
ecclesiastical manor, it seems easy to trace the signs of ancient
common, commonable meadow, and common fields.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole of the Weald of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex appears
never to have passed through the common-field system. This
is indicated in the first place by the fact that there have been
no Enclosure Acts for enclosing common fields. Secondly, we
have what may be termed the expert evidence of William
Marshall, the shrewdest of all the eighteenth-century agricultural
writers, and the only one really interested in the origin and
early history of the common-field system. He says of the
Maidstone district, “the entire district appears to have been
inclosed from the forest or pasture state. I observed not a trace
of common-field lands” (<cite><a id="s_dist_vol1">“Southern District,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr></a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 21</cite>).
Of the Weald of Kent, “The whole is in a state of inclosure,
and mostly divided by wide woodland belts, into well sized
fields” (<cite><i><a href="#s_dist_vol1" title="Go to previous citation.">Ibid.</a></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 345</cite>). Of the Weald of Sussex, “... there
being, I believe, no trace at present, of common fields having
ever gained an establishment” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 100</cite>). <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>“The whole
of the district (between Pulborough and Midhurst) under view
is in a state of Inclosure; except a few small heathlets and
commons; and except a small remnant of common field in the
Maam soil.” The Maam soil, he says, is a vein of land of
peculiar nature at the foot of the chalk hills, to be identified,
presumably, with the Gault formation.</p>

<p>In 1649, seeing that a considerable amount of common field
survived in the part of Surrey north of the North Downs,
until the time of Parliamentary enclosure, and some in Sussex
south of the South Downs, and in spite of this, Blith speaks of
Surrey and Sussex as enclosed counties, enclosure must at least
have predominated in the Weald.</p>

<p>Celia Fiennes adds a confirmation. Sussex, she says, is
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">much in blind, dark lanes</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32</cite>). This implies narrow
roads, with well-grown hedges, that is, ancient enclosure. For
roads are everywhere broad in proportion as the industrial state at
which enclosure takes place is advanced. Again, from Calvery
to Branklye, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the way is thro’ lanes, being an Enclosed
Country for the most part, as is much of Sussex which joyns to
Kent</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 112</cite>). And the view from Boxhill was that of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a

<h4 title="" class="smcap">North Surrey.</h4>

<p>The part of Surrey which lies on the north slope of the North
Downs, from the Kent boundary to the Bagshot sands, contained
up till the time of Parliamentary enclosure a considerable
proportion of common-field land, as may be seen by the <a href="#appendix_b" title="Go to Appendix B.">appendix</a>
and the <a href="#south" title="Go to the map of the Weald.">map</a>.</p>

<p>James and Malcom, the reporters for Surrey, give a
list of the chief common fields remaining in 1793 (<cite>“Agriculture
of Surrey,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 43</cite>), from which we find that besides
Merrow, enclosed about 1870, East and West Clandon,
Ashtead and Thorpe have been enclosed without Acts since.
In each of these four cases enclosure took place before the
date of tithe commutation.</p>

<p>But even this part of Surrey must be considered as on the whole
an early enclosed district; as much so, in fact, as the corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
slope of the Chiltern Hills, and the Hertfordshire Hills on the
other side of the Thames.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">The Sea Coast of Sussex.</h4>

<p>The western part of the south slope of the Sussex Downs has
a few examples of common fields surviving to a late date, but
they are fewer in number and smaller in area than on the north
slope of the Surrey Downs. William Marshall says: “In the
Isle of <i>Selsey</i> I observed some common field land; also about
Chichester, in the year 1791” (<cite>Southern District, <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 230</cite>.)
The accompanying map shows the parishes enclosed by Acts.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Wessex.</h4>

<p>Under the heading of Wessex I include the counties of
Hampshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire and Dorset. There is a close
resemblance between the enclosure history of each of these;
while Gloucester is a connecting link between them and the
Midland counties on the one hand, and the south-western on the
other. It may be described as at present a country of very large
farms, with a very large proportion of open down, the cultivated
land itself remaining remarkably open, being divided in general
into large rectangular fields by hedges which are frequently full
of gaps. Rights of common here more than elsewhere have
decayed, irrespective of actual enclosure; and using the word
enclosure in its broad sense, it may be said that in Wessex the
process of enclosure has least of all taken visible shape, either
in the growing of hedges, or building of walls, or in the
conversion of arable to pasture, or pasture to arable, or in the
scattering of the habitations of the inhabitants over the whole
parish; but that it has most profoundly affected the social life of
the villages. The case of Grimstone, in which the nine
“livings” for generations held by about a dozen different
copyholders, was converted into a single farm, and by no means
an exceptionally large one, is typical of the whole district. This
aspect has been previously treated. What here has to be
noticed is that these characteristics of Wessex enclosure make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>it more difficult to trace the progress, at least so far as the
higher lands are concerned. If Celia Fiennes could revisit the
neighbourhood of Amesbury and Stonehenge, she would probably
again describe it as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">all on the downs, a fine champion country</span>.”
It is fortunate that we have the accounts of two such expert
observers as Thomas Davis and William Marshall. They wrote
practically at the same date, Marshall apparently in 1792,
Davis in 1793; but as Marshall confines himself to the actual
condition, while Davis deals with the past, he must here take
precedence.</p>

<h4 title="">“<span class="smcap">The Western Chalk Hills.</span></h4>

<p>“<i>Basingstoke to Salisbury.</i>&mdash;The state of inclosure varies. To
the eastward the country is mostly inclosed, much of it in large,
square, regular inclosures. More westward, it is entirely open;
as are the tops of the higher hills throughout. Extensive views,
with no other break, than what is given by corn or flocks, fallows
or the sheep fold.</p>

<p>“<i>Environs of Salisbury.</i>&mdash;To the southward of the town there
are some well-sized, square fields, with good live hedges (at
least on three sides) apparently of forty or fifty years’ growth;
yet, extraordinary as it is, many of these fields lie open to the
roads; the fences on the sides next the lanes lying in a state of
neglect. And, to the north of the Avon, the country for many
miles every way, lies open, unless about villages and hamlets,
and along the narrow bottoms of the watered valleys. To the
eastward of Salisbury an attempt has been made at inclosure;
the ruins of the hedges are still evident; broken banks, with
here and there a hawthorn. And similar instances are observable
in other parts of the Downs.</p>

<p>“Are we to infer from hence, that chalk down lands are not
proper to be kept in a state of inclosure? Or that where sheep
are kept in flocks, and few cattle are kept, fences are not
requisite? Or is the foliage of shrubs a natural and favourite
food of sheep, and hence, in a country chiefly stocked with sheep,
it is difficult to preserve a live hedge from destruction?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>
<p>“<i>Ludgershall to Basingstoke.</i>&mdash;The country is wholly inclosed:
excepting a few plots to the right; mostly in large
square fields, doubtless from a state of open down; the hedges
in general of a Middle Age; some instances of vacant
inclosure.</p>

<p>“With respect to the present state of appropriation of this
tract of country,<a name="Anchor_103" id="Anchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a> the mere traveller is liable to be deceived.
From the more public roads, the whole appears to be in a state
of divided property. But on a closer examination, much of it is
found to be in a state of commonage. In the immediate
environs of Salisbury, there are evident remains of a common
field, lying in narrow strips, intermixed, in the south of
England manner; and not far from it, a common cow pasture
and a common meadow. About Mere” (on the Somerset border
of Wiltshire) “I observed the same appearances. In the Valley
of Amesbury much of the land remains, I understand, under
similar circumstances, though they do not so evidently appear in
the arable lands, which by the aggregation of estates, or of farms,
or by exchanges among landlords and their tenants, lie mostly
in well-sized pieces. But the after-eatage,<a name="Anchor_104" id="Anchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> whether of the
stubbs or the meadows, is enjoyed in common. And the grass
downs of the common field townships are in a state of common
pasture the year round; being stinted by the arable lands”
(<cite>“Southern District,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 308, etc</cite>.).</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_103" id="Footnote_103" href="#Anchor_103" title="Return to text.">[103]</a> <i>I.e.</i>, the whole of the district he calls “the Western Chalk hills.”

    <li>
      <a name="Footnote_104" id="Footnote_104" href="#Anchor_104" title="Return to text.">[104]</a> “After-eatage.” This is Marshall’s variant of “average,” showing his
theory of the etymology of the word, a theory which might have been suggested
to him by the quaint phrase common in Enclosure Acts: “The averages
whereof are eaten and enjoyed by the proprietors according to a recognised
stint.”
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>One fact to be noticed is that Hampshire was earlier enclosed
than Wiltshire; which is in accordance with what one would
have expected. Enclosure spread westwards into Hampshire
from Surrey and Sussex.</p>

<p>Davis I have previously quoted. “The greater part of this
county (Wiltshire) was formerly, and at no very remote period, in
the hands of great proprietors. Almost every manor had its
resident lord, who held part of the lands in demesne, and granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>out the rest by copy or lease to under tenants, usually for three
lives renewable. A state of commonage, and particularly of open
common fields, was peculiarly favourable to this tenure.
Inclosures naturally tend to its extinction.</p>

<p>“The North-West of Wiltshire being much better adapted to
inclosures and to sub-division of property than the South, was
inclosed first; while the South-East or Down district, has undergone
few inclosures and still fewer sub-divisions” (<cite>“Agriculture
of Wiltshire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8</cite>).</p>

<p>We have previously seen that Cobbett, traversing that same
South-East district of Wiltshire, found in 1825 the common field
or “tenantry” system completely superseded by that of great
farms. Parliamentary enclosure only partly effected the change,
which appears to have been so complete in the space of a single
generation, 1793–1825. The violent fluctuations in the price of
grain during the great war, the wholesale ruin of farmers in 1815
and 1816, the abuse of the Poor Law peculiarly rampant in
Wiltshire, by which the peasants who held such little holdings
as we have observed in Fordington and Stratton and Grimstone,
by lease or copy, were compelled to pay in their rates the wages
of the labourers employed by the great farmers who were superseding
them, and the decay of home industries to which Cobbett
bears witness, all these were complementary parts of the social
transition, each assisting all the others, and all together converting
the tiller of the soil from the peasant with a medieval
status, a responsible member of a self-governing village
community, into a pauperised, half-starved labourer.</p>

<p>Though North-West Wiltshire was enclosed earlier than the
South-East, Berkshire was enclosed later than Wiltshire as a
whole. This is indicated by the scope and distribution of
Enclosure Acts. Parliamentary enclosure covers 26·0 per cent.
of Berkshire, 24·1 per cent. of Wiltshire. Of the total 120,002
acres enclosed by Act in Berkshire, 42,631 acres was enclosed in
the eighteenth century; 77,371 acres in the nineteenth. In
Wiltshire the proportions are reversed; 126,060 acres were
enclosed in the eighteenth century, 86,073 acres in the
nineteenth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>The non-Parliamentary enclosure in the nineteenth century
was peculiarly active in Berkshire. William Pearce, the Board
of Agriculture surveyor, computed that in 1794 the common
fields and downs occupied 220,000 acres; forests, wastes, and
commons, 40,000; and the enclosed lands, including parks and
woods, only 170,000 acres (<cite>“Agriculture of Berkshire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13</cite>).
He further assures us that at least half of the arable land was in
common fields (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>). As rather less than 20 per cent. of the
total area of the county was enclosed by Acts at a later date, it
would follow that about 30 per cent. of its area was enclosed
without Acts after 1793; and from my own inquiries I can quite
believe this conclusion is accurate. Enclosure under the general
Acts of 1836 and 1840 may have been specially extensive in
Berkshire.</p>

<p>Dorset underwent enclosure at an earlier period. The
percentage of Parliamentary enclosure is only 8·7, which is
similar to that of Hampshire, 6.0; and there is no evidence of
very extensive non-Parliamentary enclosure in the nineteenth
century. Stevenson in 1812 reported, “There are but few
uninclosed fields remaining” (<cite>“Agriculture of Dorset,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 194</cite>);
and the earlier reporter, Claridge, in 1794, said, “Very few
parishes in this county have of late years been enclosed”
(<cite>“Agriculture of Dorset,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46</cite>). In the intervening period only
fourteen Acts enclosing sixteen parishes were passed; Dorset
must therefore have been mainly enclosed before the time of the
American War; enclosure having no doubt spread eastwards from
Devonshire, which was a very old enclosed county.</p>

<p>Celia Fiennes adds little to our information, except that she
says the Vale of the White Horse, in Berkshire, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">extends a vast
way, a rich jnclosed country</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19</cite>), that there were “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Good
lands, meadows, woods and jnclosures</span>” in the Isle of Purbeck,
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 6</cite>), and that the country round “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Stonidge</span>,” like that round
Newtontony, was “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">most champion and open, husbandry mostly
corn and sheep</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 10</cite>). But there is a significant passage in
John Norden, which shows that the characteristic Wiltshire and
Dorsetshire common-field management in 1600 prevailed over all
four counties. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">In Dorset, Wiltshire, Hamshire, Barkeshire,
and other places champion, the farmers do much inrich their
land indeed with the sheepfold</span>” (<cite>Book <abbr title="5">V.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 232</cite>).</p>

<p>Leland, however, is full of information. He came into Berkshire
at Wallingford, and rode thence to Abingdon and to
Oxford. The first touch of description is “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">About this Sinodune
beginneth the fruteful Vale of White Horse&mdash;this Vale is not
plentifulle of woodde</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 14</cite>). This must be compared
with Celia Fiennes’ description of the same Vale, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a rich
jnclosed country</span>.” He next proceeded westwards along the
southern side of the Thames. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">From this place</span>” (Hinxey hill,
one mile from Oxford) the hilly ground was “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">meately woody for
the space of a mile, and thens 10 miles al by Chaumpain, and
sum Corne, but most pasture, to Farington</span>.” He crossed the
river and entered Gloucestershire, but turning south entered
Wiltshire, and found the eight miles from Cirencester to
Malmesbury “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">about a Mile on Furse then al by Champayne
Ground, fruteful of corne and Grasse, but very little wood</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 26</cite>). To Chippenham “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">al the Ground on that side of the
Ryver was Chaumpayne</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 28</cite>) but towards Bradford “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the
countre beginneth to wax woddy</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 30</cite>); and then he went west
into Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. He came back into Dorset
from Axmouth, and in the extreme western part of Dorset gives no
distinct description of the state of enclosure&mdash;it is “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">meately
good ground</span>” or “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">corne, pasture and wood</span>;” but from Melbury
to Frome was “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng"><abbr title="6">vj</abbr> miles stille by Champaine ground on an high
rigge</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 47</cite>). He came through Weymouth and
Poole, and specified neither enclosure nor champain, till he
reaches the north-west corner of the county; but from Hoston
to Cranbourne is “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">al by Champain Ground having nother
Closure nor Wood</span>,” and all the way to Salisbury continues “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">al
by Champayne</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 56</cite>). Again, <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">“all the way from Salisbury
to Winchester is Champayne</span>,” but from Winchester to
Southampton, while there is “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">mouch drye feren Ground</span>,”
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the most part of the Ground betwixt is enclosid and reasonably
woddyd</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 74</cite>).</p>

<p>To Portsmouth enclosure predominated in the cultivated land.
There is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">much enclosid and Hethy Ground myxt with Ferne</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 79</cite>), and “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the Ground within the Isle of Portsmouth is
partely enclosid</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 82</cite>). Turning north there was some
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">playn Ground</span>” before entering Bere forest, afterwards
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">enclosid Ground</span>” to Bishops Waltham, and for three miles
beyond; the remaining four to Winchester being “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Champain</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 83</cite>).</p>

<p>But particularly in Dorset, instead of describing the land as
enclosed, or “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Champain</span>,” he frequently uses such expressions
as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">meately well woddid</span>” or “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">good Corne and sum Grasse</span>,”
which it is difficult to interpret in terms of enclosure. The
choice of such expressions probably implies (1) that there is not
much actual enclosure by hedges, and (2) that there are no
<i>extensive</i> arable common fields. Such descriptions would suit
land passing directly from the condition of forest or moor into
separate cultivation, but in which the cultivated patches were
not as yet enclosed with hedges; or a district in which small
arable common fields were surrounded by such later extensions
of cultivation. But leaving Dorset in doubt, it is clear from
Leland’s notes that enclosure was well begun in the south of
Hampshire, while the country to the north was all open.</p>

<p>In the above journey Leland skirted the central chalk district;
later he passed directly through it, going from Oxford through
Abingdon, Lambourn, Marlborough and Devizes to Trowbridge.
He passed the forests of Savernake and Blake, but all the
cultivated land is described as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champayne</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>,
Part 2, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 63–7</cite>).</p>

<p>To sum up, we find that in the south of Hampshire, the
cultivated land was early enclosed, and also probably in the south
and west of Dorset, that enclosure gradually spread from the
middle of the sixteenth century into the rest of the four counties,
the movement attacking the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champain</span>” district on three sides,
on the east from Surrey, on the south from the early enclosed
district between Winchester and Southampton and Portsmouth,
and in the west from Devon and Somerset; the progress of
enclosure appears to have been practically confined to Dorset
and Hampshire in the seventeenth century; to have had the
north-west of Wiltshire for its chief scene in the greater part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>of the eighteenth century, and finally to have attacked south-east
Wiltshire and Berkshire, the former in the first quarter, the
latter throughout the first half, of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="">THE SOUTH-WEST OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Gloucester and Worcester.</h4>

<p>The whole of Gloucester, with the exception of the Forest of
Dean and its neighbourhood in the west, has scattered over it
parishes enclosed by Acts of Parliament; and the enclosure so
effected amounted to nearly a quarter (22·5 per cent.) of the whole
area of the county. The rich land in the Severn Valley was the
latest enclosed district. William Marshall tells us that in 1789
“perhaps half the vale is undivided property.” (“<cite><a id="r_e_gloucestershire">Rural Economy
of Gloucestershire,”</a> <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16</cite>.) As enclosure by Act of
Parliament, and doubtless also without Acts, had been proceeding
vigorously since 1726, it is probable that at the earlier date
nearly the whole was in “a state of commonage.” Of the
Cotswold Hills, Marshall says: “Thirty years ago (<i>i.e.</i>, in 1759)
this district lay almost entirely in an open state, namely, in
arable common fields, sheep-walk, and cow-down. At present it
may be said to be in a state of Inclosure, though some few
townships yet remain open.” (<cite><i><a href="#r_e_gloucestershire" title="Go to previous citation.">Ibid.</a></i>, <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9</cite>.)</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that in Gloucestershire enclosure
without Acts was specially easy, in consequence of the custom
of holding land. The ancient custom of “copyhold by three
lives renewable” had very generally been converted into
“leasehold by three lives renewable,” the difference being that
the lord of the manor’s option of accepting a new life became
real instead of nominal. It was easy for a landlord who wished
to enclose to convert each such lease as it fell in to one for a short
period of years; and it was in this way, Marshall says, the
enclosure of the Cotswold Hills was mainly effected.</p>

<p>The south-west of Gloucestershire, towards Somerset, to a
considerable extent shared in the early enclosure of that county;
though for Somerset we have also to say that while the western
half was, like Devonshire, very early enclosed, the eastern half
to a certain extent shared in the comparatively late enclosure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>Gloucestershire and the north-west of Wiltshire, as the <a href="#enclosure" title="Go to the Map of Enclosure of Common Fields by Act of Parliament.">map</a>
shows.</p>

<p>Worcester similarly shows the transition between South
Warwickshire, the enclosure history of which has been dealt
with, and the counties on the Welsh border. Pomeroy reported
in 1794 to the Board of Agriculture: “The lands are in general
inclosed; there are, however, some considerable tracts in open
fields.” About 45,000 acres have since been enclosed by Acts
for enclosing common fields <i>inter alia</i>; which is perhaps as large
an area as the phrase “considerable tracts” is intended to
describe. Just one-sixth of the total area of the county is covered
by the whole series of such Acts, mainly in the eastern half of
the county. Leland tells us “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">most part of all Somersetshire is
yn hegge rowys enclosid</span>” with elms, and from his other notes
we find that the north-west half of Worcestershire was enclosed
by about 1540, and the southern extremity of Gloucestershire
about half enclosed by that date. We further find, from evidence
quoted above, that the rest of Worcestershire shared the enclosure
experience of Warwick and Leicester, though probably at a
somewhat earlier date, that is, undergoing enclosure mainly in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, though in the end the
process dragged on and was only completed after the Act of 1845
was passed. We find the Cotswold Hills enclosed mainly
between 1750 and 1790, the Severn Valley undergoing enclosure
during this period, but only about half enclosed at the end of it,
and enclosure continuing steadily to the very end of the nineteenth
century, with Elmstone Hardwicke still remaining
uninclosed, waiting for leases for lives to expire.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">The Celtic Fringe.</h4>

<p>The part of the country which remains to be considered is that
in which the problem is complicated by the question whether the
primitive village community was of an English or Celtic type.
The remaining counties may be grouped under the titles West
Wales, Strathclyde and the Welsh border.</p>

<p>We have previously seen that fluidity in the tenure of the soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
which is one characteristic of the Celtic run-rig as compared with
the Anglo-Saxon common field system, favours the separation of
properties and holdings at the time when co-aration ceases to be
practised; and, in consequence, to early enclosure without any
special efforts of the type of an Act of Parliament. But we have
also seen that a prevailingly pastoral country tends to have its
arable lands more easily and earlier enclosed than a prevailingly
arable country. There are therefore two explanations available
for the early enclosure of the whole western half of England
and Wales.</p>

<p>First, however, the broad facts with regard to the history of
enclosure must be made clear.</p>

<p>There are no Acts specifically for enclosing common arable
fields in Wales, nor any in which the phraseology of the preamble
clearly indicates the existence in Wales of land possessing all
three of the essential characteristics of English common field:
(1) intermixed ownership or occupation, (2) absence of adequate
hedges or other obstacles to the passage of men and animals
from one holding to another, (3) common rights exercisable over
the tilled land.</p>

<p>But there were<a name="Anchor_105" id="Anchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a> in Wales open tilled fields in which properties
and holdings were intermixed&mdash;that is, land possessing the first
two characteristics. Several Welsh Acts for enclosing commonable
waste also enclose “intermixed lands,” and one (<cite>1843,
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 14</cite>) is for the enclosure in Llandudno and three neighbouring
villages, of “Divers Commons, commonable lands and waste
grounds, Heaths, open and Common and other Fields and Waste
lands, and other Common lands and Waste grounds, which lie
intermixed in small parcels, and are inconveniently situated for
the use and enjoyment of the several proprietors.”</p>

<p>The following are the reports on the subject by the Board of
Agriculture reporters in 1793 and 1794:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>“Open or Common Fields are rarely met with in South Wales.
It is a mode of cultivation only practised in a few instances,
where ecclesiastical and private property are blended.” (<cite>John
Fox, “Agriculture of Glamorgan,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 41</cite>.)</p>

<p>“The only tract like a common field is an extent of very productive
barley land, reaching on the coast from Aberavon to
Llanrhysted. This quarter is much intermixed, and chiefly in
small holdings.” (<cite>Thomas Lloyd, “Agriculture of Cardigan,”
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 29</cite>.)</p>

<p><i>Carmarthen.</i> “I do not know of any considerable extent of
open common field in the county.” (<cite>Charles Hassell, “Agriculture
of Carmarthen,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 21</cite>.)</p>

<p><i>Pembroke.</i> “In the neighbourhood of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David’s considerable
tracts of open field lands are still remaining which is chiefly
owing to the possessions of the church being intermixed with
private property.” (<cite>Charles Hassell, “Agriculture of Pembroke,”
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20</cite>.)</p>

<p><i>Radnor.</i> “Here are no Common Fields.” (<cite>John Clark,
“Agriculture of Radnor,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 21</cite>.)</p>

<p><i>Flint.</i> “There are no common fields, or fields in run-rig, in
this county, except between Flint and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Asaph, and it is in
intention to divide and inclose them.” (<cite>George Kay, “Agriculture
of Flint,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 4</cite>.)</p>

<p><i>Cærnarvon.</i> “Run-rig. There are no lands of this description
that I could hear of, but there is a good deal of mixed
property that might be exchanged.” (<cite>George Kay, “Agriculture
of Cærnarvon</cite>.”)</p>

<p>There was in existence a mere remnant of open intermixed,
arable land, which one reporter evidently thinks ought to be
described as run-rig, and not as common field. Though in
many respects agricultural methods were of the most primitive
type, yet enclosure was practically complete; in two out of the
four counties in which open fields are stated to be surviving, the
explanation of such an exceptional circumstance is given in the
intermixture of church and lay property. This well corroborates
the <i>a priori</i> argument that the Celtic type of village community
easily yields to enclosure; and that a predominance of pasture
over arable also facilitates early enclosure of what arable there is.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>Mr. A. N. Palmer shows that the varying operation of the
custom of gavelkind (equal inheritance by all sons) is also closely
connected with the recent phenomena of the distribution of
holdings. Everywhere the land which was ancient open arable
fields is now, and has been for an unknown period dating at least as
far back as 1620, divided by hedges into small enclosures, as in
Devonshire; but in some districts these contain, or are known
to have contained in comparatively recent times, intermixed
quillets of other ownership. In these districts Mr. Palmer
supposes the ancient “<span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">gafæl</span>” or “<span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">gwely</span>” (which may be
roughly defined as a patriarchal family holding), was at the time
when co-aration ceased, very much sub-divided. In other districts
where the “<span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">gafæl</span>” or “<span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">gwely</span>” was little sub-divided, so that
each occupier could support his own plough team, when co-aration
ceased, holdings became entirely separated from one another.
(<cite>“History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales,” <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
35–37</cite>.)</p>

<p>We have now to fix with what accuracy we may the time of
the enclosure of the western counties, and then to search for
evidence in those counties of variations from the typical English
village community.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Devon, Cornwall and West Somerset.</h4>

<p>These counties were very early enclosed. There is so much
earlier evidence that it seems superfluous to quote Celia Fiennes,
but there are some suggestive touches in her description.</p>

<p>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I entered into Devonshire 5 miles off from Wellington, just
on a high ridge of hills which discovers a vast prospect on Each
side full of Inclosures and lesser hills which is the description
of most part of the West. You could see large tracts of grounds
full of Enclosures, good grass and corn beset with quicksetts and
hedgerows</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 206</cite>). In very similar words she describes the
views on the roads from Exeter to Chudleigh, and from Chudleigh
to Ashburton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Devonshire is Much like Somersetshire, fruitfull countrys for
corn, graseing, much for inclosures that makes the wayes very
narrow, so as in some places a coach and waggons cannot pass.
They are forced to carry their corn and carriagis on horses backes
with frames of woods like pannyers on either side of the horse,
so load it high and tye it with cords. This they do altogether
the further westward they goe, for the wayes grow narrower and
narrower up to the land’s end</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9</cite>). As Celia Fiennes rode
into the far west of Cornwall, hers is the evidence of an eye-witness.
She points to the explanation of the extreme narrowness
for which Devonshire lanes are still noted&mdash;enclosure took
place before the introduction of carts.</p>

<p>Devonshire is spoken of in the previously quoted passage in
the “<cite lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Discourse of the Commonweal</cite>,” about 1550, as, with
Essex and Kent, one of the most enclosed counties. Leland,
about the year 1537 passed through North Devon into Cornwall,
as far as Wadebridge and Bodmin, and back through South
Devon. His statement that Somerset was much enclosed with
hedgerows of elms, has already been quoted. In Devon and
Cornwall he found no “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaine</span>,” but frequently “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">meately
good corne and grasse</span>;” on the other hand, he frequently
found enclosure.</p>

<p>After recording his arrival at Dunster, he says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">From
Combane to the Sterte most part of the Shore is Hilly Ground,
and nere the Shore is no Store of wood; that that is ys al in
Hegge rowes of Enclosures</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 63</cite>). There was
enclosed ground between Bideford and Torrington (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 68</cite>);
from Torrington to Launceston was either “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">hilly and much
enclosid</span>,” or “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">hilly and much morisch</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 69</cite>), and also
from Launceston to Boscastle (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 72</cite>).</p>

<p>Entering South Devon, he remarks simply on the fertility of
the soil, but remarks: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The hole Ground bytwixt Torrebay and
Exmouth booth sumwhat to the shore and especially inward is
wel inclosed</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 31</cite>).</p>

<p>In the year of Leland’s visit, probably either 1537 or 1538,
the cultivated lands of Devon and Cornwall and Somerset were
largely, but not entirely, enclosed. In East Somerset alone did
Leland find any land which he could describe as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaine</span>”;
we may infer therefore that though no doubt there was a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>deal of open field arable, probably still cultivated by co-aration,
it existed in the form of comparatively small areas round villages
and hamlets; nowhere, in Leland’s route, extending over a
considerable tract of country.</p>

<p>Carew, in his book on Cornwall, dated 1600, gives an account
of the enclosure of that county. Of the manorial tenants, he
says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">They fal everywhere from Commons to Inclosure and
partake not of some Eastern Tenants envious dispositions, who
will sooner prejudice their owne present thrift, by continuing
this <i>mingle mangle</i>, than advance the Lordes expectant benefit,
after their terme expired</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30</cite>).</p>

<p>This pregnant passage tells us&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That the Enclosure of tilled land in Cornwall had been
proceeding rapidly up to 1600 and was then nearly complete;</p>

<p>(2) That previous to enclosure the system of cultivation,
whether it most resembled the English common field system
or Scotch run-rig, had for one of its features the intermixture
of holdings; and for another some elements of collective
ownership or management entitling it to the name “Commons”;</p>

<p>(3) That Carew’s conception of a manorial tenant is not that
of a freeholder, nor of a copyholder, but that of a leaseholder,
whose term expires, the lord of the manor reaping the fruit, on
the expiration of the lease, of any improvements the tenant may
have made. He further on explains that the system of leases
for three lives was practically universal in Cornwall, not in the
modern form in which any three lives may be named in the
lease, but depending for its continuance on the lives of the
lessee, his widow and his son. It is obvious that this condition
of land tenure would be more favourable to early enclosure than
copyhold.</p>

<p>Another passage in Carew bears witness to the practical
completion of enclosure. Writing of the legal conditions under
which the miners pursued their enterprise, he says: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Their
workes, both streame and Load, lie either in severall or in
waistrell</span>,” that is, either in enclosed land under separate
exclusive ownership and occupation, or in waste. One cannot
draw the inference that there was absolutely no open field land;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
but merely that its extent was in comparison so small as to
appear negligible in this connection to Carew.</p>

<p>Though it is not improbable that the enclosure of Cornwall
took place at an earlier stage of agricultural evolution than that
of Devonshire, it is somewhat improbable that it took place at
an earlier date. It is a reasonable inference from the evidence
that by the end of the sixteenth century the enclosure of Devon
and Cornwall was practically complete. When it began is a
different question.</p>

<p>The charter of John by which all Devonshire except Dartmoor
and Exmoor was deforested, expressly forbids the making of
hedges on those two forests. This is itself some evidence that
enclosure of some sort, probably enclosure of waste, for the
purpose of cultivation, was going on actively in the beginning of
the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Attention must here be drawn to an ancient custom in Devon
and Cornwall surviving to the end of the eighteenth century.
William Marshall gives an account of it, and shows its probable
importance in determining the character of enclosure and of all
the attendant circumstances in Devon and Cornwall.</p>

<p>“<i>West Devonshire.</i> This district has no traces of common
fields. The cultivated lands are all enclosed, mostly in well
sized enclosures; generally large in proportion to the sizes of
farms. They have every appearance of having been formed from
a state of common pasture; in which state, some considerable
part of the District still remains; and what is observable, the
better parts of these open commons have evidently been heretofore
in a state of aration; lying in obvious ridges and furrows;
with generally the remains of hedgebanks, corresponding with
the ridges, and with faint traces of buildings.</p>

<p>“From these circumstances it is understood by some men of
observation, that these lands have formerly been in a state of
permanent inclosure, and have been thrown up again, to a state
of commonage, through a decrease in the population of the
country.</p>

<p>“But from observations made in different parts of Devonshire,
these appearances, which are common, perhaps, to every part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
of the county, would rather seem to have arisen out of a custom,
peculiar perhaps to this part of the island, and which still
remains in use, of lords of manors having the privileges of
letting portions of the common lands, lying within their
respective precincts, to tenants, for the purpose of taking one or
more crops of corn, and then suffering the land to revert to a
state of grass and commonage.</p>

<p>“In the infancy of society, and while the country remained in
the forest state, this was a most rational and eligible way of
proceeding. The rough sides of the dells and dingles with
which it abounds were most fit for the production of wood; the
flatter, better parts of the surface of the country were required
for corn and pasturage; and how could a more ready way of
procuring both have been fallen upon than that of giving due
portions of it to the industrious part of the inhabitants, to clear
away the wood and adjust the surface, and after having reaped a
few crops of corn to pay the expense of cultivation, to throw it
up to grass, before it had become too much exhausted to prevent
its becoming, in a few years, profitable sward? In this manner
the county would be supplied progressively as population
increased, with corn and pasturage, and the forests be converted,
by degrees, into common pasture.</p>

<p>“The wild or unreclaimed lands being at length gone over in
this way, some other source of arable crops would be requisite.
Indeed, before this could take place, the pasture grounds would
be disproportionate to the corn lands; and out of these
circumstances, it is highly probable, arose the present Inclosures.”
(<cite>“Rural Economy of the West of England,” 1795,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31</cite>.)</p>

<p>The same custom was observed in Cornwall by G. B. Morgan,
the Board of Agriculture Reporter. (<cite>“Agriculture of Cornwall,”
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46</cite>.)</p>

<p>I believe this custom is the explanation of the huge size of
the hedges which is frequently observable in Devonshire. A
mound about eight feet high, and six or seven feet through,
surmounted by a quickset hedge, is not uncommon. When a
plot of land which had once been enclosed from the waste for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
cultivation, and then thrown into common pasture, with its hedges
cast down, had recovered its fertility, it would naturally again
be selected for enclosure and cultivation; the cast down rough
stone wall, now overgrown with vegetation, would be made the
foundation for a new hedge; and the same process might be
repeated several times before final enclosure.</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">Braunton Great Field.</h4>

<p>I have said above that it is reasonable to infer from the evidence
that enclosure was practically complete in Devon and Cornwall
by the end of the sixteenth century. It is not, however,
absolutely complete to the present day; for Braunton Great
Field remains uninclosed. Braunton is a little town of about
two thousand inhabitants, situated between Ilfracombe and
Barnstaple, near the sea coast. Braunton Field is said to have
“as many acres as there are days in the year,” each nominal
acre being a strip of land of about an acre in area. Properties
and holdings are very much intermixed, many of the holdings
are very small and cultivated by their owners. Each “acre” is
separated from the rest on each side by a balk of untilled land,
growing grass, yarrow, hawkweed, etc., just a foot wide. They
are locally known as “launchers,” which one associates with the
Dorset name “lawns” for the strips of ploughed land, and the
name “landshare,” in the Stratton Court rolls for the unploughed
balks.</p>

<p>There is also always a path, or a broader balk, called an “edge,”
separating the different sets of acres, which elsewhere would be
called “Shots” or “Furlongs,” from one another.</p>

<p>No common rights exist at present, or have existed in living
memory over either the unploughed balks, or the tillage lands
themselves. But old villagers remember that long ago one half
of the field was kept for wheat, and the other half for potatoes,
clover, etc., in other words, that there use to be a common rule
for the cultivation of the field and this common rule was similar
to that prevailing in the Gloucestershire every year lands. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
present each occupant cultivates his strips just as he pleases.
It is of course possible that this obsolete common rule is itself a
survival from an older one, and that originally this field was
cultivated on the two-field system so prevalent in Lincolnshire;
half under wheat, half fallow, the fallow being commonable all
the year, and the wheat after harvest. But on the other hand,
the custom of getting a crop every year may have been the
original one, and Braunton Great Field may be ancient “Every
Year land” or “Infield.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="braunton">
   <img src="images/braunton.jpg" alt="Part of Braunton Great Field." title="Part of Braunton Great Field." width="600" height="624" />
   <p class="caption_braunton">The dotted lines represent bulks separating adjacent strips in the open field; the
continuous lines represent hedges. It is easy to see how the enclosures on the edge of the
field were made out of two or three strips thrown together.</p>
</div>

<p>Braunton Field is noteworthy in that it shows that however
the primitive village community of West Wales may have
differed from that of Wessex, it must have had certain
characteristics in common with it, by which open arable fields
of intermixed occupation were created in the neighbourhood of
villages. Braunton cannot have been from the beginning an
isolated example. The process of enclosure by the method
Marshall describes went on around and outside these ancient
tilled open fields.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is revealed by the study of the twenty-five
inch Ordnance map for Braunton. Braunton Field has been
much reduced in area; one can easily see that the adjoining
lands were once part of the open field, for the hedges in the
lands are so placed as to form a continuation of the spider-web
lines of the “launchers” within the field. The average size of
the enclosed fields outside the Great Field is indeed a little
greater than of the separate lands within it, but there is an
imperceptible gradation, beginning with the smallest “lands” in
the Great Field which are nearest the village, on through those
more remote, the nearer enclosed fields, and then the more
remote of them. Enclosure has been effected by simply enclosing
the strips of arable land in the open field as they are. The
fact that no common rights existed over the Field, supposing this
always to have been the case, would have made such enclosure
almost a matter of indifference to the other occupiers; and the
motive, no doubt, would be the desire to lay the strip down in
pasture. The whole field is known to the villagers as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>“the
tillage land.”</p>

<h4 title="" class="smcap">The Welsh Border.</h4>

<p>The enclosure history of the counties along the Welsh border
is somewhat similar to that of Devonshire. It took place early,
partly in consequence of the predominance of pasture over arable,
and partly under the influence of a custom of temporarily enclosing
the waste and common pasture, similar to that in Devon
and Cornwall.</p>

<p>The percentages of area of these counties enclosed by Acts for
enclosure of common field arable are respectively:</p>

<p>The Board of Agriculture reporter’s statements on the common
fields surviving in 1793 are that in Cheshire there was not so
much as 1,000 acres (<cite>Wedge, “Agriculture of Cheshire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9</cite>);
in Staffordshire little more than 1,000 acres (<cite>Pitt, “Agriculture
of Staffordshire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 85</cite>); that Shropshire “does not contain much
common field land” (<cite>J. Bishton, “Agriculture of Shropshire,”
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8</cite>); but that in Hereford some of the best lands of the county
are common fields (<cite>Clark, “Agriculture of Hereford,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 69</cite>). Of
Hereford, William Marshall gives a fuller account. “Herefordshire
is an inclosed county. Some few remnants of common
fields are seen in what is called the upper part of the county;
but in general it appears to have been inclosed from the forest
state; crooked fences and winding narrow lanes” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 224</cite>).</p>

<p>Celia Fiennes found from Nantwich to Chester “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">much
Enclosures</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 147</cite>), but from Salford to Northwich, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I went
a very pleasant roade, much in the downs, mostly campion ground,
some few Enclosures</span>”; Herefordshire, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a country of Gardens
and Orchards, with apple and pear trees thick in the hedgerows</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 33</cite>); Staffordshire, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">well wooded and full of Enclosures,
Good Rich Ground, extremely differing from Derbyshire</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 89</cite>).
This was her first impression, confirmed later. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Harteshill is
so high that from the top of it you see near 20 miles round, and
shows all the county which in this part of Staffordshire is full
of woods and jnclosures and good lands, except the Knackwood</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 137</cite>). From “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Nedwoodforest</span>” ... “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">you have a fine
prospect of the country, enclosed good lands</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139</cite>). Also
beyond Stafford towards Cheshire was mostly enclosures (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 144</cite>),
and from Stafford to Wolverhampton the journey was through
lanes (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 194</cite>).</p>

<p>Walter Blyth includes Staffordshire and Shropshire as part of
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the Woodlands, who before Enclosure, were wont to be relieved
by the Fieldon, with corn of all sorts. And now grown as gallant
Corne countries as be in England</span>” (<cite>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The English Improver</span>,”
1649, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40</cite>).</p>

<p>Evidence of early enclosure is supplied by Leland. About
White Castle, which I take to be Bishop’s Castle, in south-west
Shropshire, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the Countrys is Champion</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 176 b</cite>),
but from Hereford to Leominster was enclosed ground (<cite>176 b
and 177 a</cite>), thence towards Ludlow “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">by goodly corne Ground,
part by enclosed</span>” (<cite>178 b</cite>), Bridgenorth to Kidderminster “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">most
by enclosed Ground</span>” (<cite>182 b</cite>), to Bewdly was by “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a fayre downe</span>,”
but all the way thence to Milton (4 miles), Hertlebury (2 miles),
Salopbrook (5 miles), Worcester (3 miles), Wick (6 miles) and
Bromsgrove (4 miles), each stage is said to be by enclosed ground
(<cite><abbr title="folios">fols.</abbr> 183 b–186 a</cite>).</p>

<p>As for Monmouthshire, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The soyle of al Venteland</span>” (Gwent,
the country between the Wye and Usk) “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">is of dark reddish
Yerth ful of slaty stones, and other greater of the same colour.
The country is also sumwhat mountaynous and well replenished
with Woodes, also fertile of Corne; but men there study more to
Pastures, the which be wel inclosed</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="5">V.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 5</cite>), and
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Erchenfeld is full of Enclosures very (fruteful) of Corne and
Wood</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 9</cite>). Round Shrewsbury there is “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">ground plentiful
of Corne, wood and pasture</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="5">V.</abbr>, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 80</cite>), at Whitchurch
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">meately fruteful sandy ground</span>” (<cite><a id="fiennes_vol5_fol81"><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 81</a></cite>), and sandy ground on
to Northwich (<cite><i><a href="#fiennes_vol5_fol81" title="Go to previous citation.">ibid.</a></i></cite>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>Nowhere else in these counties is either “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">enclosure</span>” or
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champaine</span>” specified.</p>

<p>The evidence as to the existence of a custom of temporary
enclosure of the waste, is supplied by Robert Plot’s book on
“Staffordshire,” published in 1686: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">For the heathy land of this
County, it is seldom enclosed; but when they intend it for tillage,
which is never for above five years neither, and then it is throwne
open to the Commons again</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 343</cite>). “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Their gouty, moorisch,
peaty, cold black land, they husbande also much after the same
manner as they doe the heathy lands in the Moore Lands</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 345</cite>).</p>

<p>Another passage brings into juxtaposition the more recent
enclosures from forest or moor for the sake of tillage, and the
ancient arable common fields. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Others again have placed the
origin of mildewing in making small inclosures, corn not being
so lyable to this evil in the common open fields</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 351</cite>).</p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose that the custom found in Staffordshire
and in Devon and Cornwall also prevailed in other counties,
particularly in those along the Welsh border. It is some confirmation
that Eden about a hundred years later found a similar
custom still surviving in Sutton Coldfield, in Warwickshire, but
near the Staffordshire boundary.</p>

<p>“The poor here, besides the right of commonage, have this
peculiar privilege, that every house-keeper may take in one acre
of common, and plough it four years: and the fifth year he
must sow it with clover and lay it to the common again; after
which he may take another acre, and work it in the like manner.
By this method, about 400 acres of common are kept constantly
in tillage” (<cite>“State of the Poor,” <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 749, written
probably in 1795</cite>).</p>

<p>The enclosure history of these five counties may be summed
up in the statement that it probably proceeded very similarly to
enclosure in Devonshire, but at a somewhat later date; and
that enclosure was later towards the north. Monmouth, we see,
was “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">full of enclosures</span>” before 1540; Shropshire “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">partly
enclosed</span>” with some “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">champion</span>”; but though Leland passed
through Cheshire, he does not mention enclosures, and Celia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>Fiennes found the North of Cheshire mostly open as late as
about 1697. In Hereford and Staffordshire there was a large
proportion of ancient arable land, and complete enclosure was
consequently longer delayed, leaving an appreciable area to be
enclosed by Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strathclyde.</span></p>

<p>Lancashire had no common field enclosed by Act of Parliament.
It is possible that its partial autonomy as a Palatine County may
account for this; but it must be noticed that the Acts of
enclosure for Lancashire for enclosing commonable waste, are
numerous right through the period of Enclosure Acts. Nor,
though Lancashire was an early enclosed county, can we explain
the absence of Enclosure Acts by the assumption that the
enclosure of tilled land was completed by the beginning of the
eighteenth century, for some common field persisted to the end
of that century.</p>

<p>John Holt, the Board of Agriculture reporter, tells us:
“There are but few open, or common fields, at this time remaining;
the inconvenience attending which, while they were in that
state, have caused great exertions to accomplish a division, in
order that every individual might cultivate his own lands,
according to his own method; and that the lots of a few acres,
in many places divided into small portions, and again separated
at different distances, might be brought together into one
point” (<cite>“Agriculture of Lancashire,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>). It would appear
from this that the open fields of Lancashire, like Braunton Great
Field, though unenclosed, and intermixed, and subject to some
common rule for cultivation, were not subject to common rights.
Any owner, therefore, who by exchanges or by buying and selling,
could get his lands together in a convenient plot, might enclose
without trespassing on his neighbours’ rights.</p>

<p>From Holt’s statement we find that enclosure was nearly, but
not quite, complete by 1793. It was certainly far advanced a
hundred years earlier. Celia Fiennes rode from Prescot to
Wigan, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">seven long miles mostly through lanes</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 153</cite>);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
from Gascoyne to Lancaster, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">mostly all along lanes being an
enclosed country</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 157</cite>). From Blackstone Edge the view
was of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a fruitfull valley full of jnclosures</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 186</cite>). From
Rochdale to Manchester, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the grounds were all enclosed with
quicksetts</span>” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 187</cite>).</p>

<p>Similarly Leland: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Manchester to Morle I passid by enclosid
Grounde partely pasturable, partely fruteful of corn</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> <abbr title="5">V.</abbr>,
<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 83</cite>). “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The Ground bytwixt Morle and Preston enclosid for
Pasture and Cornes.... Likewyse is the soile bytwixt Preston
and Garstan; but alway the moste parte of Enclosures be for
Pasturages</span>” (<cite><abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 84</cite>).</p>

<p>Cumberland and Westmoreland were later enclosed than
Lancashire; and some few remnants of open arable field were
dealt with by Acts. At Bolton, in Westmoreland, “certain open
or common fields called Broad Ing Bartle and Star Ing” of 22
acres, at Soulby 90 acres of open field, and at Barton 130 acres,
were enclosed by Acts mainly passed for the sake of enclosing
waste; and at Kirkby, in Kendal, “a common open field” of 105
acres was enclosed. There were five Acts in Cumberland
enclosing open fields; but only two say precisely how much.
At Torpenton, 20 acres of field and 700 acres of waste was
enclosed; at Greystoke, 240 acres of field and 3260 acres of waste.</p>

<p>But the enclosure of open-field arable was proceeding very
steadily through the eighteenth century; and a clear account of
the process is furnished us by two keen observers.</p>

<p>Eden gives an account of the condition of the arable land
in seven Cumberland parishes, written either in December, 1794,
or January, 1795.</p>

<p>“<i>Gilcrux.</i> About 400 acres of common field have been
enclosed within the last fifty years” (<cite><a id="poor">“State of the Poor,”

<p>“<i>Hesket.</i> No more than 200 acres have been enclosed within
the last fifty years. A large part appears to have had its hedges
planted a little before that period” (<cite><i><a href="#poor" title="Go to previous citation.">Ibid.</a></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 81</cite>).</p>

<p id="carrock">“<i>Castle Carrock.</i> The greatest part of this parish remains
in <i>dales</i>, or <i>doles</i> as they are called; which are strips of

<p>“<i>Cumrew.</i> The land is cultivated in the old Cumberland

<p>“<i>Warwick.</i> Almost the whole of the cultivated land (1126

left unploughed. In this manner a great deal, and perhaps the
whole, of the cultivated lands in Cumberland, was anciently
disposed” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 92</cite>).</p>

<p>The other observer is the poet Wordsworth. In his book
on the scenery of the lake district, he quotes from West’s
“<cite>Antiquities of Furness</cite>” to show that in the troubled times
between the union of the Crowns of England and Scotland,
holdings were let to groups of four tenants, each group dividing
its tenement into four equal parts. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>“These divisions were not
properly distinguished; the land remained mixed; each tenant
had a share through all the arable and meadow land, and
common of pasture over all the wastes.... The land being
mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough,
the absence of the fourth man” (who was called out for military
service) “was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land, which
was committed to the care of three.” In High Furness, “The
Abbots of Furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals, and permitted
them to enclose quillets to their houses, for which they
paid encroachment rent.”</p>

<p>Wordsworth then proceeds with the tale of enclosure: “The
enclosures, formed by the tenantry, are for a long time confined
to the homesteads, and the arable and meadow land of the fields
is possessed in common fields; the several portions being
marked out by stones, bushes, or trees; while portions, where
the custom has survived, to this day are called <i>dales</i>, from the
word deylen, to distribute; but while the valley was thus lying
open, enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the
mountains; because the land there was not intermixed, and was
of little comparative value; and therefore small opposition
would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose
habitations it was contiguous. Hence the singular appearance
which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit, intersected,
as they are, almost to the summit with stone walls.... There”
(in the meadows and lower grounds), “where the increasing
value of land, and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed
plots of ground in common field, had induced each inhabitant
to enclose his own, they were compelled to make fences of alders,
willows, and other trees ... but these last partitions do not
seem to have been general till long past the pacification of the
Borders, by the union of the two crowns” (<cite>Fourth Edition, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</cite>).</p>

<p>The date of the enclosure of the intermixed arable and
meadow land is thus fixed within certain broad limits. It did
not begin till “long past the pacification of the Borders, by the
union of the two crowns.” It took some time to effect the
pacification of the Borders, even after the accession of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
made it possible; “long past” that event is a vague date, but
may very well bring us at least as late as the date when the
enclosure of the common fields of Durham is supposed to have
begun, “soon after the Restoration.” It is certain, further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
from Eden’s information, that enclosure was going on steadily
right through the second half of the eighteenth century, but by
no means complete in 1795. The high prices of the war period
would have greatly stimulated the movement, for it is obvious
that if rents were thereby doubled both for open and enclosed
land, the gross profit of enclosing would also be doubled; the
net gain probably more than doubled. When Wordsworth
wrote, the open fields were apparently still fairly numerous, but
they had become a mere survival.</p>

<p>The date of the enclosure of this district is, however, the
least interesting of the inferences to be drawn.</p>

<p>We find that up to the union of the Crowns, cultivation was
carried on by a system very closely resembling the “run-rig”
of the Hebrides. Groups of four tenants combined together,
and yoked their horses to a common plough, and equally divided
the holding between them, each tenant having his equal share
in all parts of the holding. We next find that on the decay of
this co-aration, for a long period, varying in duration in different
parishes, holdings remained intermixed, but it seems clear that
as in the one surviving Devonshire open field, and probably as
in Lancashire, common rights were not exercised over the arable
fields; though it might happen that besides the “ranes,” the
grassy balks between the strips of arable land, there might be
considerable stretches of grass amidst the arable field which was
used for a common pasture. Lastly, we find that open, intermixed
arable land and meadows, having this history, passes into
a state of enclosure where increase of population, agricultural
progress, and the increasing value of land make enclosure sufficiently
profitable, by a gradual, piecemeal process, without the
need for Act of Parliament, or reference to a Commission, or
any combined resolution on the part of the lord and tenants of a
manor.</p>

<p>It is because the process was late in Cumberland and Westmoreland
and because it happened to interest three authors,
West, Wordsworth, and Eden, who were not agriculturists, that
the record of it for these two counties is available. All the
indications suggest that Northumberland and Durham underwent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
a similar evolution; and all the preceding information with
regard to the enclosure of Wales and much of the land immediately
on the Welsh border, and of West Somerset, Devon and
Cornwall, harmonises with the hypothesis that in those districts
also the process was fundamentally the same, though with local
differences, due to a very much earlier pacification.</p>

<span class="sub_head">THE RESULTS OF ENCLOSURE.</span></h2>

<p>The scenery of England and Wales has been transformed by
the enclosure of its lands, but the extent and results of the transformation
vary. Here you have the landscape cut into little
fields with great hedges, looking from an elevated point of view
like a patchwork quilt; there the skimpy quickest hedges only
slightly emphasise the natural sweeping lines of the hills: here
you have narrow winding lanes; there broad, straight roads
with margins of grass on either side: here you have compact
villages in which almost all the habitations in the parish are
clustered together; there farmhouses and cottages so scattered
that were it not for the church, which seems to attract to its
neighbourhood the inn and the smithy, there would be no recognisable
village at all.</p>

<p>This diversity in the effect of enclosure on the face of the
country is a symbol of the diversity of its effect upon the material,
social, and moral conditions of the local peasantry, who, like the
land itself, may be said to have undergone Enclosure.</p>

<p>Where, as in Devon and Cornwall, in Cumberland and Westmoreland,
the division of intermixed arable and meadow land
took place early and gradually, and in subordination to the
reclamation of waste, that reclamation itself being carried on
steadily and gradually, the result was the creation of numberless
small holdings and properties. A career was offered to the
enterprising and laborious, and enterprise and industry grew
accordingly,&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Devonshire myghty and Strong</span>,” says Leland;
and the great part taken by Devonshire in the national struggles
in the reign of Elizabeth must be partly attributed to the reaction
upon the character of the people of the conquest over the
difficulties of bringing the rocky soil, woodland or moor, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
cultivation: a conquest which made Devonshire husbandry famous
for two generations, and “Devonshiring” a well-known term for
a particular method of preparing waste land for cultivation.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest evil of Acts for the enclosure of waste
in the past, was that they prevented such gradual reclamation
and enclosure by peasant cultivators. At the present day the vital
objection applies to enclosure of waste by any method that the
area of such free open spaces is already sufficiently curtailed,
that every remaining acre is becoming continually more precious,
so that while public-spirited people fight for their preservation
in remote places, in the neighbourhood of towns, citizens tax
themselves to add to their area.</p>

<p>The enclosure of arable common fields, and of all the commonable
lands of whole parishes within what I have called the
Parliamentary Enclosure Belt, is of immeasurably greater
historical importance. The ethics of such enclosure has been
the subject of fierce debate for centuries; now the process is
practically complete, and it is possible to apraise its results.</p>

<p>We have observed that with regard to the immediate results,
capable of being contemporaneously verified, there is no real
controversy between the disputants; it is on the inferences to be
drawn as to the more ultimate results on the nation as a whole,
and in the judgment pronounced upon the desirability of such
results, that the dispute turned. The more candid disputants
on either side admit the vital points in their opponents’ case:
thus, for example, no opponent of enclosure denies that it
tended to raise rents; and, on the other hand, it was the greatest
advocate of enclosure who declared that “By nineteen out of
twenty Enclosure Acts the poor are injured.”</p>

<p>The increase of rent was, of course, the motive of enclosure;
and though there were exceptional cases in which the results
were very disappointing to the promoters, as a rule the increase
of rent was very great. Arthur Young gives the full financial
details of twenty-three Acts for the enclosure of open field parishes
in Lincolnshire.<a name="Anchor_108" id="Anchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> The total rents before enclosure amounted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
<abbr title="15,504 pounds">£15,504</abbr>; on an average they were nearly doubled, the increase
of rent obtained being <abbr title="14,256 pounds">£14,256</abbr>, and the expenditure necessary
to obtain this result was <abbr title="48,217 pounds">£48,217</abbr>. Assuming that the money
was borrowed at 6 per cent., there remained to the landowners a
net profit of <abbr title="11,363 pounds">£11,363</abbr>. These results were no doubt something
above the average, but they were not exceptional. In Long
Sutton the rent was raised from an average of <abbr title="5 shillings">5<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre to
between <abbr title="30 shillings">30<i>s.</i></abbr> and <abbr title="50 shillings">50<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre.<a name="Anchor_109" id="Anchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a></p>

<p>The increase of rent was not a concern purely of the landowning
class. As the advocates of enclosure continually pointed
out, the rent was a pretty accurate test of the net produce of the
agriculture of the parish; it was roughly proportional to the
amount of food grown but not consumed on the spot, and sent
away to markets to feed urban consumers at a distance. It was
upon this net produce, they pointed out, that the taxable resources
of the country depended. It was argued that an addition to the
population of the country which was all engaged in gaining its
own subsistence from the soil, added neither to the number of
soldiers who could be enlisted for war without paralysing industry,
nor to the power of the State to equip and support an army. On
the other hand, a change by which a whole village of peasants
who consumed nearly all the food they produced, was swept away
and replaced by one or two highly rented farms, producing a less
quantity of food, but sending much more to market, did supply
the State with additional resources for the maintenance of its
forces.</p>

<p>Private interests stimulated the appreciation of these public
advantages. Money had to be borrowed to meet the heavy
initial expenses of enclosure, and the banking system grew with
the enclosure movement of the eighteenth century. And
hence a secondary gain to the State. Increased opportunities
for the remunerative investment of capital increased
the supply of loanable capital, and made possible the enormous
State loans by which the Napoleonic war was carried on.
Lawyers, land surveyors, Parliamentary agents and others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
reaped a copious harvest; and further, London in particular,
and other towns in varying measure, grew in wealth by ministering
to the increased “effective demands” of the enriched
aristocracy.</p>

<p>But the opponents of enclosure were concerned with the gross
rather than the net produce of land, and, as we have seen, it can
be proved from the testimony of the advocates of enclosure and of
impartial witnesses, that over a great part of the Midlands
enclosure meant the conversion of arable to pasture, and local
depopulation. The Board of Agriculture gives what may be
considered an official estimate of the diminution of gross produce
which would follow. An acre of common field arable might be
expected to produce 2010 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of bread in a three years course (that
is, 670 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of bread per annum), and 30 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of meat per annum.
The same area enclosed and converted to pasture would produce
176 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of mutton, or 120 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of beef. If we split the difference
between the production of beef and mutton, we have on the average
148 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of meat produced. There is on enclosure a gain of
113 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of meat against a loss of 570 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of bread; supposing
the food values of equal quantities of bread and meat to be
equal, there is a loss of 557 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> out of a total produce of
705 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr></p>

<p>And yet, through a chain of causation which can now be clearly
perceived, but which at the time was not evident, though locally
there might be a loss of gross produce, there was a gain throughout
the kingdom. The key to the position was the operation of
the Poor Laws.</p>

<p>Enclosure of arable fields and open field parishes in the
Parliamentary Enclosure Belt in many ways greatly affected the
operation of the Poor Laws.</p>

<p>By increasing rents it made a given poor-rate yield more.
Further, the increase of rent reconciled the enclosing landowners
to an increase in the poor-rate; more especially when it fell, not on
them, but on their neighbours. For, as we have seen, the effect of
enclosure in some parishes in a given neighbourhood was often
to drive the poor into the parishes which remained unenclosed;
these bore the burden, while the others reaped the profits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>As we have seen, enclosure, even when arable was not converted
to pasturage, tended to ruin small owners and to eliminate small
farmers, so that these had to join the ranks of agricultural
labourers. The number of potential paupers was thus increased.</p>

<p>Destitution and recklessness among the labouring classes also
increased. The common rights and small holdings of a few acres
in the common fields were, at best, as we have seen, exchanged
for a sum of money for which no investment offered itself,
which therefore soon disappeared. With these small holdings
disappeared also the hope of gradually taking more and more
additional strips of land in the fields and the fear of losing the
little already gained.</p>

<p>Early marriage was particularly encouraged by the change
from the open field condition to enclosure. Before enclosure,
the conditions of labour made the common field farmers who
employed labourers, desire young unmarried men and women
who would live in the farmhouse; such farm servants postponed
marriage till they had accumulated some savings and could begin
their married life with some resources&mdash;a cow, for example&mdash;over
and above their labour. After enclosure, the enriched
farming class preferred to pay board wages, and the young
labourer with nothing to gain by waiting, with the assurance
of Poor Law assistance if needed, naturally preferred to marry
early.</p>

<p>Lastly, the disappearance of the yeoman class and of the
connecting links between the largest farmers and the day
labourers naturally tended to make the careful local administration
of the Poor Law more difficult; it even to a great extent
destroyed the motive for economical administration. The open
field parish retained some of the social vitality of a self-governing
community; men who had to concert together for the regulation
of the fields, for the purchase of a parish bull, were more likely
than the farmers of an enclosed parish to settle in concert
questions of Poor Law relief in accordance with the interest of
the parish as a whole.</p>

<p>This last point of connection between the enclosure and the
Poor Law history of the country during the eighteenth century and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the first part of the nineteenth is, however, interesting in itself,
apart from the present argument. The point here laid stress
upon is that whatever hardships for labourers and others resulted
from the enclosure of arable fields, they did not starve, they did
not eat less bread; they might be rendered miserable, but they
married earlier and reared large families, somewhere or other.
Poor Law relief ensured their offering an “effective demand”
for bread. This effective demand compelled the increase of
arable cultivation somewhere within the country; for foreign
supplies were practically unavailable. The enclosure of waste for
tillage and the enclosure of arable for pasture were economically
inter-dependent.</p>

<p>The gross agricultural produce of the country as a whole was
therefore increased by common field enclosure.</p>

<p>The effect upon urban industries was also great. The greater
the local depopulation in rural districts produced by enclosure,
the greater the supply of needy labourers of industrious habits
and robust physique drafted to the growing industrial towns.
Local depopulation was the usual result of Enclosure, as we
have seen, in the Midlands and in Wiltshire, and parts of
neighbouring counties. Where, as in Norfolk and parts of
Lincoln and Yorkshire, local depopulation did not ensue, there
was a vast increase in the agricultural produce sent to market,
and in consequence, in the manufactured commodities demanded.
Enclosure tended to assist urban industry therefore by an
increased labour supply, an increased market, and perhaps also,
an increased supply of capital.</p>

<p>Summing up, therefore, the economic results of the whole mass
of little village revolutions under examination, we find increased
population, increased production of all sorts of commodities,
increased national resources for purposes of taxation and foreign
war. The moral effects we find to have been increased misery
and recklessness, showing itself in increased pauperism and
drunkenness. An increase of the quantity of human life is attained
at the expense of a degradation in its quality.</p>

<p class="gap">From 1727 to 1760 the number of Acts of this class passed per
annum was steadily increasing, the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763)
apparently acting as a stimulus. During this period the average
acreage enclosed per Act was 1330·7 acres. The increase in the number
of Acts continued up till 1792, and again at a greatly enhanced rate
after the beginning of the great French war. From 1761–1792 the
average acreage enclosed per Act was 1410·8 acres; from 1792–1801,
1504·9 acres. In 1801 a Clauses Act, termed “A General Enclosure
Act” was passed to facilitate Parliamentary proceedings. This had
the double effect of increasing the average number of Acts passed
per annum from 20 to 43, but of reducing the average acreage per
Act to 1313·4 acres. From 1816–1845 the average acreage per Act
was 816·8 acres.</p>

<p>Enabled lords of manors in which the waste was used as a common

no specific grant of a right of common pasture had been made. It
also provided against the creation of new common rights. “ <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">By

than 2,000 sheep under a penalty of <abbr title="3 shillings and 4 pence">3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></abbr> per sheep per annum,
half of the fine going to the crown, half to the informer. No man,

<p>This Act requires that so much land be tilled yearly in any parish
as had been tilled at any time since the accession of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>,
under a penalty of <abbr title="5 shillings">5<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre per annum.</p>

<p>Four Commissioners were to be appointed to enquire into the
conversion of arable into pasture.</p>

<p>The Act did not apply to&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Land that had been pasture for 40 years.</li>
<li>(2) Waste ground, common downs, fens, moors, marshes.</li>
<li>(3) Lawful warren.</li>
<li>(4) Woodland converted into pasture.</li>

<h4 title=""><cite>2 &amp; 3 <span class="smcap">Philip and Mary</span> (1555–6), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2</cite>.</h4>

<p>This cites and confirms the original Depopulation Act of 4
Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> and makes it apply to all houses with 20 acres of land,
whether the land is in tillage or not.</p>

<p>Commissioners to be appointed to enquire into all grounds converted
into pasture since <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Day, in the 20th year of
Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> to see to the re-edifying of houses, and the reconversion
of pasture into tillage. The exceptions permitted are where lands
have been enclosed by the King’s licence, and by discretion of the
Commissioners in cases where no public benefit, but individual
hardship would ensue by the execution of the Act.</p>

<p>Rents increased on the conversion of tillage into pasture were to
be abated; re-edified houses were to be let with 20 acres of land or
10 acres if the owner has no more.</p>

<p>The penalty of laying land down into pasture was again fixed at
<abbr title="5 shillings">5<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre per annum, half to be paid to the Crown, half to the
informer.</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>5 <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> (1563), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2</cite>.</h4>

<p>By this Act the more recent Depopulation Acts, <cite>27 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 28</cite>, <cite>5 &amp; 6 Edward <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 5</cite>, and <cite>2 &amp; 3 Philip and Mary, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2</cite>, were
repealed as ineffectual; but the earlier ones, <cite>4 Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 19</cite>,
<cite>7 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 22</cite> and <cite>27 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 22</cite>, ordered to be put into
execution.</p>

<p>It was also enacted that “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">such lands or so much in quantity in
any place as hath been put in Tillage and eared in any one year and
so kept four years sithence the feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George the Martyr, anno
20 Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> shall be eared and kept in Tillage, according to the
Nature of the Soil and Custom of the Country by the Occupier
thereof</span>.”</p>

<p>The penalty was raised to <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre per annum, and it could
be recovered by the next heir in reversion if he sued for it within a
year, if not, by the Remainderman, or in default by the lord of the
manor, and if not so recovered, by the Crown.</p>

<p>This Act remained in force for thirty years, but was discontinued
by <cite>35 Elizabeth (1593), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 5</cite>.</p>

<h3 title="">ACT FOR THE PROTECTION OF COTTAGERS’ HOLDINGS
AND RIGHTS OF COMMON.</h3>

<h4 title=""><cite>31 <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> (1589), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 7</cite>.</h4>

<p>This Act prohibited the letting of cottages to agricultural labourers
with less than four acres of land under a penalty of <abbr title="40 shillings">40<i>s.</i></abbr> per cottage
per month, or the occupation of one cottage by more than one
family, under a penalty of <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr> per cottage per month. The amount
of land attached to cottages let to countrymen following other
occupations was also regulated. These holdings were evidently
intended to be acres in the arable fields, carrying with them the
proportional common rights of pasturage, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> This Act was repealed
in 1775.</p>

<h3 title="">DEPOPULATION ACTS.</h3>

<h4 title=""><cite>39 <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> (1597), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 1</cite>.</h4>

<p>In the preamble of this Act it is stated that in late years more
than in times past, sundry towns, parishes and houses of husbandry
have been destroyed and become desolate. All previous Acts for the
re-edification of houses are repealed, and it is enacted that when
houses of husbandry have been decayed for more than seven years,
half the number must be rebuilt, and 40 acres of land allotted to
them; unless the property had been sold meanwhile; in that case
the purchaser need only rebuild one quarter of the decayed houses.</p>

<p>Where houses had decayed within the previous seven years, they
are to be rebuilt; and if previously they had less than 40 acres of
land, they must now at least have 20 acres; if previously they had
40 acres or more, they must now have at least 40 acres.</p>

<p>The penalty for not rebuilding the farmhouse, was <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr> per house
per annum; for not assigning the prescribed quantity of land, <abbr title="10 shillings">10<i>s.</i></abbr>
per acre per annum. One third of the penalty went to the Queen,
one third to the parish, one third to the informer.</p>

<p>It is also enacted that it shall be lawful for any lord of the manor
to make exchanges of lands, whether arable, pasture or meadow, with
his tenants, and for the tenants, with the consent of the lord, to
make exchanges with one another, for the sake of more convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
occupation and husbandry. In other words the re-arrangement of
the intermixed holdings in common arable fields and common
meadows is expressly sanctioned.</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>39 <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> (1597), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2</cite>.</h4>

<p>The preamble states that from the 7th year of Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>’s reign
to the 35th year of the current reign there had always been in force
some Act for the maintenance of tillage, but in the latter year all
such laws were discontinued; and that in consequence in the period
1593–1597 “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">there have growen many more Depopulacions by turning
Tillage into Pasture than at any time for the like number of years
heretofore</span>.”</p>

<p>It is enacted that lands converted from tillage to pasture shall be
re-converted within three years, and that lands now in tillage shall
remain so, under a penalty of <abbr title="20 shillings">20<i>s.</i></abbr> per acre per annum. The Act
applies to the counties of Bedford, Berkshire, Buckingham,
Cambridge, Derby, Dorset, Durham, Gloucester, Hampshire,
Hereford, Huntingdon, Leicester, Lincoln, Northampton, Northumberland,
Nottingham, Oxford, Rutland, Somerset, Warwick, Wiltshire,
Worcester, Yorkshire, with the Isle of Wight, and Pembroke in
South Wales.</p>

<p>It did not apply to Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Devon, Essex,
Hertford, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Monmouth, Norfolk, Shropshire,
Stafford, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex and Westmoreland.</p>

<p>This Act remained on the Statute Book for 266 years. The
earlier Depopulation Acts were repealed by <cite>21 James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 28</cite>, but
this Act remained theoretically part of the law of the land until
repealed by the <cite>Statute Law Revision Act of 1863</cite>. This was the
last of the Depopulation Acts.</p>

<h3 title="">AN ENCLOSURE ACT.</h3>

<h4 title=""><cite>4 <span class="smcap">James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr></span> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 11</cite>.</h4>

<p>This is really a local Enclosure Act. The people of the parishes
of Merden, Bodenham, Wellington, Sutton <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, Sutton
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, Murton-upon-Lug, and Pipe in Hereford, had all their
lands, whether meadow, pasture or arable, open and intermixed, and
commonable “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">after Sickle and Sithe</span>.” They themselves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
accustomed to house their sheep and cattle throughout the year, and
the people of neighbouring villages took advantage of this custom to
turn in cattle after harvest. The enclosure of one third of the land
in each parish is authorised by the Act.</p>

<h3 title="">ACTS FOR IMPROVING THE CULTIVATION OF
COMMON FIELDS.</h3>

<h4 title=""><cite>13 <span class="smcap">George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr></span> (1773), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 81</cite>.</h4>

<p>This Act has been considered <a href="#chapter_9" title="Go to Chapter 9.">in the text</a>.</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>41 <span class="smcap">George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr></span> (1801), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 20</cite>.</h4>

<p>This was a temporary Act to encourage the cultivation of potatoes
in common arable fields. The famine prices of 1800–1 caused a
good deal of curious special legislation. Any occupier of land in
common fields is authorised to plant potatoes, and to guard them
from cattle grazing in the fields, on giving compensation for the loss
of the common right to the other occupiers.</p>

<h3 title="">ACTS FOR FACILITATING ENCLOSURE.</h3>

<h4 title=""><cite>41 <span class="smcap">George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr></span> (1801), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 109</cite>.</h4>

<p>This is the General Enclosure Act promoted by the Board of
Agriculture of 1793–1819. It is entitled “An Act for consolidating
in one Act certain provisions usually inserted in Acts of
inclosure, and for facilitating the mode of proving the several facts
usually required in the passing of such Acts.”</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>1 &amp; 2 <span class="smcap">George <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr></span> (1821), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 23</cite>.</h4>

<p>This amends the previous Act, so as to better regulate the
cultivation of parishes during the progress of enclosure by Act.</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>1 &amp; 2 <span class="smcap">William <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr></span> (1831), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 42</cite>.</h4>

<p>By this the churchwardens and overseers of a parish may enclose,
up to 50 acres of waste, with the consent of the lord of the manor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
and the majority of the owners of common rights, for the relief of
the poor rates, or let the land so enclosed to poor and industrious
persons. By another Act in the same session (<cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 57</cite>) the principle
is applied to Crown lands.</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>4 &amp; 5 <span class="smcap">William <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr></span> (1834), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 30</cite>.</h4>

<p>An Act to facilitate the exchange of intermixed lands in common
fields, by removing difficulties caused by some owners being minors,
insane, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<h4 title=""><cite>6 &amp; 7 <span class="smcap">William <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr></span> (1836), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 115</cite>.</h4>

<p>This is an important Act “for facilitating the enclosure of open
and arable fields in England and Wales.” Two-thirds in number
and value of common arable fields may appoint commissioners for
carrying out enclosure, as if enclosure had been authorised by a
special Act. The awards were to be deposited in the parish
churches.</p>

<p>If seven-eighths of the proprietors were agreed, enclosure could
be carried out without the appointment of commissioners.</p>

<p>This Act is not to authorise the enclosure of common fields within
10 miles of the centre of London, within 1 mile from the centre of a
town of 5,000 inhabitants, 1½ miles from one of 15,000 inhabitants,
2 miles from one of 30,000 inhabitants, 2½ miles from one of 70,000
inhabitants, or 3 miles from one of 100,000 inhabitants.</p>

<h4 title=""><cite>3 &amp; 4 <span class="smcap"><abbr title="Victoria">Vict.</abbr></span> (1840), <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 31</cite>.</h4>

<p>This was an Act amending the last, by extending its scope to
lammas meadows; and providing that persons who were dissatisfied
with awards under the preceding Act forfeited their right of appeal
if they took possession of the lands allotted to them.</p>

<h2 title="APPENDIX E. A NORFOLK OPEN FIELD PARISH" class="extra"><a name="appendix_e" id="appendix_e">APPENDIX E.</a><br />
<img class="center" src="images/hr_small.jpg" alt="Decoration" width="50" height="10" /><br />
<span class="sub_head">A NORFOLK OPEN FIELD PARISH.</span></h2>

<p>The parish of Runton, adjoining Cromer, is unenclosed, and throws
some light on Norfolk common field custom, and on the curious law
with regard to “liberties of fold courses.” There are in the parish
two villages, East and West Runton. Most of the land in the parish
is either common, or open field arable land. Of the open field arable,
about 600 acres are “half year land” and between four and five
hundred acres “whole year land.” Both the whole year land and
the half year land is intermixed, both in ownership and occupation,
but the extent of intermixture has been steadily and continuously
reduced. There is a tendency for adjoining strips of land to be let to
one and the same farmer, and he is allowed to plough down the balks,
in Runton called <i>lawns</i> or <i>loons</i>, which separate them. There are
no common rights over the whole year land. There is an area
of whole year land of 200 acres or more around each village,
which is where one would expect to find it; and very curiously, a
detached area of about 20 acres half way between the villages.
There is no well marked boundary separating whole year from half
year lands.</p>

<p>The half year lands are commonable from Michaelmas to Lady Day
old style, that is from October 11th to April 11th. There is no
prescribed rule of cultivation, but the customary course is:&mdash;first year,
wheat; second, turnips; third, barley sown with clover, the land
under this crop being “new ley land” after the barley is reaped; and
in the fourth year the land remains under clover and is called “old
ley land” or “ollay land.”</p>

<p>The peculiar feature, characteristic of Norfolk common field
agriculture, is that the owner of the Abbey Farm <em>in the next parish</em>,
has the right to pasture sheep on the half year lands of Runton; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
the words of the old Act, he has the “liberty of fold courses” of Runton.
Further, the Runton common right owners make up a flock called
“The Collet Flock,” and it is understood that wherever the Abbey
flock goes, the Collet Flock can go too.</p>

<p>But the two flocks are kept distinct, grazing separately, each with
its own shepherd.</p>

<p class="advert">ADVERTISEMENT.</p>

<p>More than that of any other Anglo-Saxon country, English Local
Government is rooted in the past, and its contemporary problems can be
neither fully understood nor adequately solved without a knowledge of
how they have arisen. This work, the first fruits of seven years’ investigation
into the development of English Local Government, combines a detailed
history of local administration in parish and county throughout England
and Wales from 1689 to 1835, with a descriptive analysis of the interesting
constitutional evolution of this most fruitful period, when local authorities
were practically free from supervision or control.</p>

<p>Avoiding discussions as to the origins of English local institutions, or
even as to their growth during the Middle Ages, it describes in vivid detail
the development of structure and function which led to the reforms of
1832–35, on which our present system is based. This description is framed
on new lines and drawn almost entirely from materials hitherto unused.
Instead of dealing principally with the law of local government, and the
successive changes in the Statute-book, the institutions themselves, and
the persons who worked them, are described as vital social tissue. The
subject matter is, in fact, not law or politics, but the life-history of the
various species of local governing bodies.</p>

<p>The manuscript records of county and parish from Northumberland to
Cornwall, from Cardigan to Kent, elucidated by contemporary literature
and biography, enable the authors to present an entirely new picture of
the internal history of England in the eighteenth century, revealing what
Justice of the Peace and Churchwarden really were, in their habits as
they lived, the way in which the daily administration of the Parish and
County was actually carried on, the manner in which the daily life of the
people was affected by contemporary influences, and the result, both on the
health and character of the nation, and in producing the difficulties that in
the twentieth century confront us.</p>

<p>The present work is complete in itself. Subsequent volumes will deal
similarly with Seignorial Franchises and Municipal Corporations, Statutory
Bodies for Special Purposes, Local Administration in relation to Poverty
and Crime and in relation to Public Health and Convenience, etc.</p>

<p class="covernote">Some of the columns of data in this book might not align properly in some e-readers. Please note that there are also text and html versions of this book available from Project Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Footnotes have been renumbered and moved to the end of the paragraph
(or, where relevant, quotation) to which they refer. A few missing footnote
anchors have been added.</p>

<p>Maps were originally included as plates, they have been moved to be
near the text they illustrate.</p>

<p>Some formatting and punctuation of abbreviations have been
standardized, and formatting and punctuation in lists has been made consistent.</p>

<p><a href="#appendix_b" title="">Appendix B</a>, Private acts enclosing common fields, was printed in two columns with,
within counties, a “Carried forward” total at the end
of each column, and a corresponding “Brought forward” total at the start of the next. These totals
are shown here in parenthesis, e.g. <span class="cf_bf">{8,309}</span>, to the right at their original position.</p>

<p>Variant spelling, inconsistent hyphenation, and inconsistent spelling of place names
are retained, however a few palpable printing errors have been
corrected.</p>

<p>Other changes that have been made are:</p>

<p><a href="#Page_14" title="Go to page 14.">Page 14</a>, <a href="#Footnote_2" title="Go to footnote 2.">footnote 2</a> “43 Geo. III. c. 81” has been changed to “13 Geo. III. c. 81”.</p>

<p>The first anchor for footnote 46, on <a href="#Page_98" title="Go to page 98.">page 98</a>, originally pointed to a footnote which said “See note ¹ on next page.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_108" title="Go to page 108.">Page 108</a>, “10,625” has been changed to “10,265” for the net gain of acres under wheat after enclosure.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
